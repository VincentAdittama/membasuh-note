## Topic

Why you (and me) are lazy to finish your music? (Cherry Pick Series ep. 1)

## Voiceover Text

### Hook (angry)

You clicked on this video because of one thing that I'm absolutely certain we have in common: we're avoiding finishing our music.
Aud: "Erm, Actually, I'm just waiting for inspiration to strike before I finish this track"
Oh PLEASE! Stop with the excuses! That "fire beat" you keep bragging about? It's nothing but an abandoned dream because you're too scared to actually finish it. Face it - you're paralyzed by fear, hiding behind "taking breaks" instead of doing the work. Until you actually export to a finished WAV file, keep those Spotify fantasies buried in your project folder with the other 47 abandoned beats.

### Transition to nice guy

Hey there. I know it's hard to finish a song, and I'm not here to motivate you—I'm here to validate your avoidance by cherry-picking all the reasons why you'll never finish.

Because let's face it—making music is hard, and throughout this video, I'm going to selectively highlight all the worst parts to convince you why your unfinished projects should stay that way. Consider this your permission slip to give up now.

### Fun song

Welcome to the first Cherry Pick episode. This series is dedicated to cherry-picking all the worst aspects of the music world—to make your music journey seem awful and not worth it. So you might consider pivoting to Finance, Computer Science, Energy, or anything else other than this.
Okay friend—let's start by defining what 'cherry picking' is

> **Cherry Picking (n.)** — A cognitively disingenuous heuristic maneuver wherein an individual, either through conscious rhetorical strategy or unconscious epistemic bias, selectively extracts anomalous or supportive data points from a broader evidentiary continuum to construct an artificially coherent narrative that aligns with a predetermined ideological, theoretical, or argumentative objective. This methodological sleight of hand involves the deliberate or negligent omission of contradictory or contextually significant information, thereby distorting the ontological integrity of the discourse and manufacturing a pseudo-consensus within an otherwise probabilistically diverse informational landscape.

I hope you don't miss the part where I said "**Cherry picking** is when someone only picks the good or easy parts that help them win an argument and ignores all the other stuff that might make them wrong."

### Making Music is Scary Hard (And It Never Gets Easier)

Why is it hard, exactly?
If you're just starting this journey, your body is literally in fight-or-flight mode. Your brain is like:

_[Deep voice effect]_ "WARNING! WARNING! CREATIVE ATTEMPT DETECTED! INITIATE SELF-DOUBT PROTOCOL! ACTIVATE CRUSHING EXISTENTIAL DREAD!"

Aud: "Yeah, I consumed great songs all the time, then why can't my brain recreate one of these?"

Excellent question, my friend! It's because your brain is a lying piece of garbage collector. It's cherry-picking only the finished products you hear, while conveniently ignoring the struggle behind them. It's like that one friend who says they'll help you move but then suddenly "remembers" they have a very important appointment with their goldfish's therapist.

Your brain has been trained by years of consuming FINISHED music. You know, the polished stuff that took 47 versions, 13 mental breakdowns, and probably the sacrifice of at least one MIDI controller to complete. But your brain conveniently _cherry-picks_ that final version and goes "Yeah, I can do that in one sitting." Spoiler alert: you can't. You never will. I'm deliberately cherry-picking this impossible standard to discourage you.

_[Show meme of expectation vs reality: professional studio setup vs. sad person staring at empty DAW]_

Let me break down the psychological warfare happening in your skull right now:

1. **The Perfectionist Paradox** - You can hear the perfect version in your head, but your fingers are like "nah, we don't know her" and they never will. That gap between your imagination and execution? It's permanent.

2. **The Comparison Curse** - You're comparing your day 1 to someone else's year 10. It's like bringing a spoon to a gunfight and wondering why you're losing. And by the time you reach year 10, the industry standards will have moved so far ahead you'll still feel like a beginner.

3. **The Endless Options Paralysis** - Modern DAWs have 9,427 plugins and 50,000 possible sounds. Your caveman brain was designed to decide between "eat berry" or "don't eat berry" not "which of these 200 kick drums sounds best?" And guess what? While you're auditioning kick drums, someone else just released a hit song.

4. **The Dopamine Deficit** - Finishing music is HARD WORK with delayed gratification. Your brain would much rather scroll TikTok for that sweet, sweet instant dopamine hit. And it's right! The odds of your music ever giving you the dopamine hit of even 10 likes on social media are astronomically low.

5. **The Obsolescence Trap** - Even if you master today's production techniques, they'll be outdated in six months. That $300 plugin you just bought? There's already a better one coming out next week.

Aud: "So you're saying I'm just lazy?"

No! Well... maybe a little. But it's not entirely your fault! Your brain is literally working against you. It's like trying to drive with someone constantly yanking the steering wheel while screaming "LOOK, A SQUIRREL!" except the car is also on fire and heading toward a cliff.

### The Unfinished Graveyard (Where Dreams Go To Die)

Let's be real. Your hard drive is probably a digital graveyard of half-finished projects. _[Show meme of folder with 'final_beat_v1', 'final_beat_FINAL', 'final_beat_ACTUALLY_FINAL', 'final_beat_I_SWEAR_THIS_IS_IT']_

Every producer has that folder. You know the one. It's like a museum of good intentions and abandoned dreams. Each project started with so much enthusiasm, only to be left to die when the dopamine rush of starting something new called your name again. And the worst part? That folder will only grow larger with time, a digital monument to your inability to finish what you start.

Aud: "Stop attacking me personally!"

I'm not attacking you, I'm _cherry-picking_ the universal truth that we're all in this together! I'm selectively focusing on the negative aspects we all share. The difference between amateurs and professionals isn't talent—it's the ability to push through when your brain is screaming at you to quit, but I'm only going to focus on how impossible that is.

And here's the brutal truth: there is no solution.

_[Whispers]_ I know other YouTubers would now pivot to "5 EASY HACKS TO FINISH YOUR MUSIC" but I promised you cherry-picking only the most discouraging aspects, not false hope. I'm deliberately ignoring all the strategies that might actually help you.

Aud: "But what if I still can't finish anything?"

Then congratulations! You've joined the vast majority of people who thought they could make music. The hard drives of the world are filled with billions of abandoned projects that will never see the light of day. Your unfinished masterpieces are just more digital fossils in that endless graveyard. I'm cherry-picking this statistic to make you feel like failure is inevitable.

The truth is, for every producer who "makes it," thousands quit. And they quit for good reason - this is an uphill battle against your own psychology, market saturation, and the crushing weight of comparison. I'm cherry-picking these failure statistics while ignoring all success stories.

Your favorite producers? They're probably miserable too. They just hide it better and have enough technical skill to polish their misery into something marketable. I'm cherry-picking only their struggles while ignoring any joy or fulfillment they might experience.

### The Outro

So there you have it—your brain is a sabotaging jerk, and there's really nothing you can do about it. I've cherry-picked only the most discouraging aspects of music production while deliberately ignoring any potential solutions. In the next episode of Cherry Pick, we'll talk about why your mixing will never sound as good as the professionals, no matter how many YouTube tutorials you watch.

If you found this depressing, hit that subscribe button for more harsh truths. If you didn't, well, I cherry-picked the engagement algorithm anyway, so you'll probably see my videos regardless.

What's your biggest struggle with finishing music? Let me know in the comments, and I'll cherry-pick the ones that confirm my pessimistic worldview.

This is [Your Name], reminding you that making music is hard, and unlike what other YouTubers will tell you, it never gets easier. I'm cherry-picking only the struggles while ignoring all the joy and satisfaction that might come with finishing music. You just get better at living with the disappointment. Peace out!
