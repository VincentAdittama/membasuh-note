## Voiceover Text
### Hook (angry)
You clicked on this video because of one thing that's I'm sure of we have in common, we are bored.
Aud: "Erm, actually, I just need some rest, I'm on my way to continue my beat making"
No you don't! I know deep down in you, you are resisting to work, your dream of making the absolute fire beat that you dream off, it's just in your mind. It's only you that think the beat is fire. See, you haven't finished it yet right, so don't expect or think about publishing it.
### Transition to nice guy
Hey there. I know it's hard to finish your song, because I'm here to make you comfortable in this state of being lazy.
because let's face it—making music is hard.
### Fun song
Welcome to the first cherry pick episode, this series will be dedicated to acknowledging "cherry picking" in music world–to make your music journey seems awful and not worth it. So you might be considering to pivot to Finance, Computer Science, Energy, or Anything else other than this.
Okay friend–let's start by defining *what is* 'cherry pickging'

> **Cherry Picking (n.)** — A cognitively disingenuous heuristic maneuver wherein an individual, either through conscious rhetorical strategy or unconscious epistemic bias, selectively extracts anomalous or supportive data points from a broader evidentiary continuum to construct an artificially coherent narrative that aligns with a predetermined ideological, theoretical, or argumentative objective. This methodological sleight of hand involves the deliberate or negligent omission of contradictory or contextually significant information, thereby distorting the ontological integrity of the discourse and manufacturing a pseudo-consensus within an otherwise probabilistically diverse informational landscape.

I hope you don't miss the part where I said "**Cherry picking** is when someone only picks the good or easy parts that help them win an argument and ignores all the other stuff that might make them wrong."
### Making Music is Scary Hard
Why is it hard exactly?
If you just starting this journey
You body is being scared

Aud: "Yeah, I consumed great songs all the time, then why is my brain can't recreate one of these?"
