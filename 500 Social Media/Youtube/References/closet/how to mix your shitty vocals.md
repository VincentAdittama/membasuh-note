here's what we're working with really know me everybody really trying to see me full day I'll be luing my St pretty disgusting pretty inappropriate a lot of Moaning doesn't sound very pleasurable if we turn on all these uh juicy [Music] effects wow this [ __ ] is so sexy closet I was I sounded as sexy as you if only I had the the sexual I could get so many hoes don't worry oh [ __ ] my space bar fell off I'm actually going to take a picture of this this is actually [ __ ] stupid I'm going to turn off my voice in this so you can hear my beautiful voice oh God here we are basically what do we do to make our vocals go from [ __ ] to pretty bearable let's find out shall we this is what all the kids called the vocal CH uh basically anfl you have to put in all all the effects you might want well it doesn't sound like anything well how about now Christ [ __ ] is laggy as hell so what in here is making my voice sound so beautiful let's go through plug-in by plugin all right so Maximus I think this might be the most confusing plug-in of all time we're going to ignore Maximus for now all you need to know for now is basically the difference is this hello wow we're just going to pretend it's not here so what do we got first ah our good old EQ now what the [ __ ] does this do you have like like the lowend like the boom boom boom and like your high-end [ __ ] which is like your and your and all that I don't really know how to explain this here's the best I can do this is this is just my highend this will break your ears do not do this [ __ ] and this is strictly lowend sounds like a webcam microphone we can get ourselves like a little phone sound effect by just highlighting the mids who gives a [ __ ] about any of that I just want it to sound decent cut off the low end here if you click on these like IUD looking things and you scroll um you can go through a bunch of options of different variations of IUD for these dots this will make the thing sharper for some reason usually if you're making it ideal to listen to a regular sound system is going to have a sub if I'm listening I don't want strictly the person's voice to be blowing up my sub I'm not doing no ASMR content just cut off the low end here look at this graph and see what needs to be boosted and what needs to be tamed down it's really all about preference which I'm sure is why you're watching this video watching a [ __ ] tutorial and they're just like you decide this is what I have for this song cutting off that sub and then it goes up here for the highend and then of course another one this one's just to boost the high end even more to blow out those eard drums the base is completely cut off anyways moving along we got our good old fruity compressor don't you love looking at a bunch of knobs and wondering what they do all this is is like it'll squash your vocals you know when someone comes by with the mega mushroom and you just get absolutely [ __ ] so for starting out like this end up like this naturally it's going to be a lot more quiet but this is a [ __ ] stupid idea before you compress it it kind of starts out like this and then once you compress it kind of gets squished like this so then you have to turn it back up again for you to be able to hear it and as a result you get that squashed vocal turned up this is a really [ __ ] for example if I'm to turn this threshold further this basically makes it so the harder I com press it the less loud I have to to hit the peak which is going to make my vocals all the same volume W all right the next thing we got on here is the DS not that DS this DS removes s's it's [ __ ] genius quite necessary especially if you're going to boost your highs this high if you can see that check this out this is [ __ ] awesome if I press this button it'll pretty much show everything that it's removing I'm going to talk about my [ __ ] and balls for a second lovely let's just move along then we have the almighty Auto auto tune this is like some [ __ ] Ancient One if you're a normal [ __ ] person you're probably going to be using an autotune that looks similar to this when you legally obtain this autotune it should come with a plugin called auto key take your bat auto key [Music] that scared the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of me but yeah here you go DV major go ahead go into your autotune and set it to DV major what do all these silly knobs do if I have it at this retune speed it's not going to do [ __ ] but the more I turn this up the more I become like little Uzi the more the more I sound like the more I sound totally like T yeah okay but okay I'm not [ __ ] that in this is maximum autotune this will like do the job but if you're a really shitty singer even this is not going to do everything for you you got to you really got to put in some more godam oh my God this guy's [ __ ] showering you guys hear that that's my favorite sound in the whole wide world my roommate showering bro it's [ __ ] 12:30 all right so where were we oh yeah autot tune my stay Lo on the Sun so I just stay floating so personally the retune speed is going to be your main knob the rest of these are kind of [ __ ] usually I go with something lower 20 or 30 maybe if I am going to go like real low though I like to turn up this Flex tune thing what this does is Bally like reverse retune speed you can get a really natural sound when I turn the auto tune the way there you don't really know me you don't really know me what else we got oh oh my favorite plugin sound good eer the most essential of all plugins so what the [ __ ] does this do um it's pretty [ __ ] [Music] clear so much better now if you've made it this far into the video everything I've told you is [ __ ] this is how you actually mix your vocal all right let's see how this sounds shall we well I'm never doing that again anyways moving along the fruity multiband compressor the multiband compressor is pretty much what you get when an EQ and a compressor have like a gross incest child this [ __ ] is horrific to look at this lets you compress the low end the mid and the high individually I just let the default preset Run next we got the love filter this is like that potion uh basically I just have this on here as a noise gate now how the [ __ ] did I make this into a Noise Gate that is a great question oh now how you adjust the settings for this absolutely no clue and we have ourselves lovely Kickstart 2 oh finally now we're done right no so some I started doing recently is instead of slapping Reverb onto the main track CU I've made separate buses buses all that means is that I took this vocal track attached it to this one and this strictly has Reverb on it have a bit of a EQ on it we're not getting a bunch of lowend Reverb I've kind of made the Reverb all go into the high mid the high mid tends to get especially muddy but if we just drench it in Reverb it's not mud that's Reverb oh hell yeah boy Valhalla vintage verb I don't know I kind of just like this cuz it has a [ __ ] ton of random presets kind of overwhelming honestly like there's so much [ __ ] and there you [ __ ] have it that's pretty much all there is background vocal is pretty much the exact same nope nope it's different that's about all I can
