- **Essential but competitive sonic element:** Music is vital to film and television but constantly vies for prominence alongside dialogue and sound effects within the "soundtrack".
- **Complex, layered "soundtrack":** The term "soundtrack" can be "slippery" for musicological study, but concepts like "sound design" and "mise-en-bande" view it as a comprehensive, multi-dimensional entity resulting from the careful placement and layering of sound, dialogue, and music, despite arguments against its inherent homogeneity.
- **Multifunctional narrative tool:** Music serves crucial roles by setting mood and emotion, providing referential and narrative cues, ensuring continuity and unity, aiding characterisation, and guiding viewer perception, sometimes manipulatively.
- **Semiotics and blurred boundaries:** Film music exploits various musical semantics (conventional, historical, bioacoustic) to create meaning. The distinction between music and sound effects, particularly with electronic scores, can become deliberately blurred, highlighting their integrated nature.
- **Context-dependent study:** Understanding the functional point of film music necessitates studying it within the full audio-visual text, considering its interaction with other sonic elements and visuals.
- **Relevance to Music History:** Studying screen music offers insights into 20th-century musical culture, connecting it to trends in "art music" like musique concrète and challenging traditional historical narratives.
- **Classic Scoring Conventions:** Gorbman's principles outline standard practices like invisibility, inaudibility, and music's function as a signifier of emotion and narrative cue.

**Concise Phrases Describing the Assignment (Blade Runner Case Study):**

- **Application of Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic:** The task requires identifying and describing musical elements based on whether they originate from within (diegetic) or outside (non-diegetic) the film's narrative world.
- **Analysing "the Blade Runner" soundtrack:** The film _Blade Runner_ is the specified case study for this analysis, particularly focusing on the Vangelis score and other sonic elements.
- **Describing Musical Characteristics and Function:** The assignment asks for a description of the characteristics of the musical illustrations and their role within the film, noting their diegetic/non-diegetic status.

**What I Have Learned:**

From these sources, I have learned several key points:

- Film and television music is not merely background but a **highly functional and interactive component** of the audio-visual experience. Its meaning and impact are intrinsically linked to visuals, dialogue, and sound effects.
- The concept of the "soundtrack," while debated as a perfectly homogenous entity, is valuable for highlighting the **increasingly integrated and complex nature of screen sound**, especially with modern "sound design" practices.
- Classical film scoring techniques, such as those outlined by Gorbman, rely on **established conventions** to shape viewer emotion and understanding, sometimes even subtly manipulating audience expectations.
- The lines between music and other sounds can be **purposefully blurred**, particularly in electronic scores, demonstrating a continuum of sonic elements contributing to the overall soundscape (e.g., the "peeping" computer sounds in _Blade Runner_ evolving into musical notes).
- Analysing screen music effectively requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, drawing on knowledge of music theory, film studies (including visual techniques, narrative, and genre), and broader critical theories.
- The _Blade Runner_ case study effectively illustrates how different sonic elements, including ambiguous sounds and shifts between diegetic and non-diegetic music, work together to build atmosphere, characterise individuals (like Rachael's progression), and influence the viewer's interpretation of events.
- The study of screen music is a relatively new but significant area within musicology that **challenges traditional views of music history** by positioning functional, electronically mediated music at the centre of 20th-century musical culture.

# Blade Runner: Director’s Cut

Based on the sources and our conversation, the _Blade Runner_ case study, particularly focusing on the Vangelis score (1982), serves as a central example to illustrate key issues and concepts within the larger context of Music in Film and Television.

The sources introduce a short sequence from _Blade Runner: Director’s Cut_ as a case study to explore what music’s role is in film and television and the approaches to its study. The music for the film was composed by Vangelis and was largely created in an electronic studio.

The specific sequence analysed involves Rick Deckard and Rachael in Deckard's apartment. The scene begins with a near-musical "roomtone" described as a faint, low hum. When Rachael reveals she is a replicant, this cues **"pit," or nondiegetic music**. This music is described as synthesised, with "dark" C minor string sounds lending uncertainty and a potentially ominous ring, suggesting physical reactions like shivering or a quickening heart. This is an early example in the scene where the sense of a distinction between sound and music begins to dissolve.

As Deckard moves into the bathroom, the roomtone becomes more prominent, acting as an ominous pedal note. According to narrative film-music conventions, this **increases the expectation that something might happen**. More electroacoustic shuddering effects and conventionalised computer-sounds ("peep peep peep") are heard. Initially, whether these are diegetic sounds from the computer or replicant Rachael thinking is unclear. The synth string sonority grows louder as Rachael approaches Deckard, encouraging the viewer to think she might attack him. This illustrates how music can be used to **guide viewer perception and create expectations**.

However, the ominous music suddenly dissolves when Deckard is revealed to be safe, and Rachael merely asks a question. Descending flutters of computer "peeping" return, seeming attached both to the computer screen and to Rachael. With a close-up of Rachael, the peeping appears to specifically attach to her replicant thought processes, amplifying her visual framing as a replicant. When she speaks against the ominous underscore, her voice seems unnaturally controlled, suggesting she is "fake" or "dangerous".

The music shifts as Rachael enters Deckard's room, with the confirmed suggestion of a saxophone playing what is identified as the **"Love Theme"**. This languid saxophone line, with its alternating chords and jazz inflections, absorbs the sleeping and erotic connotations of the image, and perhaps links to the film's "noir" genre associations. This audio-visual combination creates an **eroticised point of view**, specifically Rachael's. The music continues to underscore her actions of undressing.

Subsequently, Rachael starts to play the piano, with her music initially being **"source" or "diegetic" music**. This diegetic piano music soon combines seamlessly with the synth strings and saxophone, illustrating a **blurring of diegetic and nondiegetic sound**. A plagal gesture in the music brings connotations of slumber, dreams, and innocence, linking to Deckard's nap and Rachael's interaction with photos. The soundworld of this scene, including the music, is seen as narrating something of Rachael's **character's progression from replicant to feeling- and memory-filled human(oid)**, imbuing the scene with humanity, even nostalgia.

However, when Deckard attempts to kiss Rachael and she appears puzzled, the music takes another ominous turn, leading the viewer to question if she feels anything and whether the music had been misleading. This highlights the potentially **manipulative use of music** to create and resolve fears and beliefs.

The _Blade Runner_ case study is used throughout the sources to exemplify broader points about music in film and television:

1.  **The Soundtrack as a Slippery Object and Sound Design:** The sequence demonstrates that the "soundtrack" is not always a simple separation of music, sound effects, and dialogue. The "peeping" computer sounds, for instance, move from ambiguous sound effects to perceived high-pitched synthesised musical notes that are part of the electronic underscore. This **deliberate mutation** of sound effects into musical sounds is a feature of the scene, reflecting the sci-fi setting's preoccupation with technology and highlighting how music and sound effects can easily mutate into one another, especially with a synthesised score. This integration is a key aspect of modern **"sound design"**, which involves the careful layering and three-dimensional placement of all sonic elements (sound, dialogue, and music). The concept of **"mise-en-bande"** is presented as a useful equivalent to "mise-en-scène" for describing the nature and placement of all sonic elements within the soundtrack, a concept particularly relevant to a complex soundscape like _Blade Runner_'s. While Michel Chion argues "there is no soundtrack" in the sense of a homogenous, interdependent entity, the complexity of sound design makes contemplating the comprehensive "soundtrack" revealing.
2.  **Role of Music (Narrative Cueing and Emotion):** The case study clearly illustrates Gorbman's principles. The nondiegetic music acts as a **signifier of emotion** (uncertainty, ominousness, eroticism, innocence, renewed suspicion) and provides **narrative cues**, increasing expectation and interpreting/illustrating events (Rachael's emotional state, her approach, her progression). Music contributes to positioning the audio-viewer. In the _Blade Runner_ scene, this positioning is described as particularly manipulative, helping to create thriller-style genre effects.
3.  **Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic and Blurring:** The scene features clear examples of both diegetic (Rachael playing the piano) and non-diegetic music (the synthesised underscore, the saxophone theme). Importantly, it shows how the lines between these can blur, as the piano music seamlessly combines with the non-diegetic elements, an example of what Robynn Stilwell calls the "fantastical gap". This blurring is further evident in the ambiguity and transformation of the computer "peeping" sounds.
4.  **Characterisation:** Music is shown to aid in **characterisation**. The progression of sounds associated with Rachael, from the ambiguous "peeping" to the complex musical sounds including the quasi-vibes and piano, contributes to her characterisation as a replicant becoming human-like and engages with themes of memory. Even the sound of Rachael's closely miked voice, detached from her physical presence, contributes to the construction of her character's half-human, half-robot status.
5.  **Source Material Issues:** The analysis of _Blade Runner_ highlights the practical challenges in studying film music. The Vangelis score was largely electronic, and a written score is not readily available, even for such a well-known film. This is common for more recent electronic scores composed directly into a computer. This necessitates studying the audio-visual text itself or making transcriptions.
6.  **Relevance to Music History:** The electronic nature of Vangelis's score and the blurring of music and sound effects connect the film soundtrack phenomenon to trends in 20th-century "art music" like musique concrète and electroacoustic music. The theoretical work of Michel Chion, an electroacoustic composer himself, provides vocabulary relevant to describing such sound events. The sources suggest that screen music like _Blade Runner_'s challenges traditional music history narratives and positions the cinematic soundtrack as a potentially central element of 20th-century musical culture, experienced by more people than "art music".

In summary, the _Blade Runner_ case study illustrates that music in film and television is a highly functional, often integrated element of a complex soundscape. It serves crucial narrative and emotional roles, often adhering to conventions but also capable of blurring boundaries and manipulating viewer perception. Studying such a score requires attending to its interaction with sound effects, dialogue, and visuals within the full audio-visual text, reflecting broader developments in sound design and connecting to important trends in modern music history.

# How to Present

Based on the sources and our conversation, here's how you can approach presenting findings on the _Blade Runner_ case study without necessarily watching the entire film, by leveraging existing research and focusing on specific elements:

1.  **Focus on the Specific Sequence Analysed:** The provided case study in the sources focuses on a **short sequence** about an hour into _Blade Runner: Director’s Cut_. You can structure your presentation around the analysis of _this specific sequence_ (Rick Deckard and Rachael in Deckard's apartment) as detailed in the source. This avoids the need to watch the full film while still engaging deeply with a significant part of its soundtrack.

2.  **Leverage Existing Analysis from the Source:** The sources _provide_ a detailed analysis of this particular _Blade Runner_ sequence. You can present the findings _of this analysis_, describing:

    - The initial "roomtone".
    - The cueing of nondiegetic music when Rachael reveals she is a replicant.
    - The characteristics of the synthesised music (dark C minor, shuddering sounds) and its emotional/narrative function (uncertainty, ominousness, suggesting anxiety/fear).
    - How the roomtone becomes a prominent "ominous pedal note" increasing expectation.
    - The introduction and ambiguity of the "peep peep peep" computer sounds and how they mutate.
    - How the synth string sonority grows louder as Rachael approaches, guiding viewer perception.
    - The sudden dissolution of ominous music and the return of peeping.
    - The association of the peeping with Rachael's replicant thought processes.
    - How Rachael's voice sounds against the underscore.
    - The introduction of the saxophone "Love Theme".
    - The qualities and connotations of the saxophone music (languid, jazz, sleeping, erotic, noir) and how it creates an "eroticized point of view" (Rachael's).
    - Rachael playing the piano and the **blurring of diegetic and non-diegetic music** as it combines with the underscore.
    - The "plagal gesture" and its connotations (slumber, dreams, innocence, nostalgia).
    - How the "soundworld" narrates Rachael's character progression.
    - The return of ominous music when Deckard tries to kiss her, questioning if she feels anything and whether the music was misleading.

3.  **Incorporate Theoretical Frameworks and Scholarly Concepts:** The sources explicitly discuss using existing research and theories to understand film music. You can use the _Blade Runner_ sequence as an example to illustrate these concepts:

    - **Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic Music:** Use Rachael's piano playing and the synth underscore to explain this distinction, and the moment they combine to illustrate the "fantastical gap" or blurring.
    - **Gorbman's Principles:** Apply relevant principles from Box 12.1 to the sequence, such as "Signifier of emotion" (e.g., dark strings = uncertainty/ominousness, saxophone = eroticism/nostalgia) and "Narrative cueing" (e.g., increasing expectation, interpreting Rachael's thoughts or potential danger). The potential for music to violate principles for effect is also shown when the music seems misleading.
    - **Sound Design and the Slippery Soundtrack:** Use the mutation of the computer "peeping" sounds and the integration of music, sound effects, and dialogue to discuss the concept of the "soundtrack" as a complex, slippery object and the importance of "sound design" or "mise-en-bande". The sources highlight how _Blade Runner_'s electronic score facilitates this blurring.
    - **Semiotic/Semantic Analysis:** Discuss how certain musical gestures or sounds carry meaning (e.g., the "dark" strings, the jazz saxophone, the "lullaby" gesture, the "peeping") and how these depend on genre conventions, music history, or even "bioacoustic" readings.
    - **Manipulation and Positioning:** Explain how the music in this sequence is used to "position" the audio-viewer, creating and resolving fears and beliefs, potentially for "thriller-style genre effects".
    - **Challenges of Studying Electronic Scores:** Mention that _Blade Runner_'s electronic score is an example of a film where a written score is likely unavailable, necessitating analysis directly from the audio-visual text. This is a key issue discussed in the sources.

4.  **Reference the Director's Cut:** The sources explicitly state the case study uses the _Director's Cut_. You can mention that different versions of a film can exist and complicate study, but focusing on the _Director's Cut_ sequence as presented is a valid scope for analysis.

In essence, you can present the findings by focusing on the detailed analysis of the selected _Blade Runner_ sequence as provided in the sources, using it as a practical example to explain the theoretical concepts and challenges of studying film music discussed elsewhere in the text (like Gorbman's principles, diegetic/nondiegetic distinctions, sound design, semiotics, and source material issues for electronic scores). This approach allows you to demonstrate understanding of the case study and its relevance to the broader context of music in film and television without needing to analyse the entire film yourself.

# Sound Diegetic
Based on the sources and our conversation, **diegetic** and **non-diegetic** are fundamental terms used to categorize sounds within the context of film and television soundtracks. The distinction hinges on whether the sound originates from within the narrative world of the film or television show.

Here's a breakdown of each:

## Diegetic Sound

*   **Definition:** Diegetic sounds are those that originate from **within the story world** of the film or television show. The characters within the narrative can theoretically hear these sounds.
*   **Origin of Term:** The term comes from the Greek word *diegesis*, meaning narration or narrative, highlighting that these sounds are part of the narrated world.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Dialogue:** Characters speaking. This can include various forms, although voiceovers can sometimes blur the line. The sonic quality of dialogue can also be diegetic, such as Deckard's choked voice in *Blade Runner*.
    *   **Sound Effects (Noises):** Sounds that are produced by objects, actions, or the environment within the scene. These make the scene feel more realistic. Examples include:
        *   The "peep peep peep" computer sounds in the *Blade Runner* sequence.
        *   Footsteps.
        *   Car noises or a car honking.
        *   Gunshots or battle sounds like explosions and gunfire.
        *   Environmental sounds like wind, rain, thunder.
        *   Sounds of objects moving.
        *   Sounds created by a **Foley artist** to sync with on-screen action, such as the brushing of clothes, tapping fingers on a keyboard, or the breaking of glass. Foley sound is considered entirely diegetic.
        *   Specific sounds created for the film's world, like the sound of a light saber.
        *   Animal sounds, such as bird sounds in *The Birds*.
    *   **Diegetic Music (Source Music):** Music that is being performed or played from a source that exists within the film's world.
        *   Rachael playing the piano in Deckard's apartment in *Blade Runner*.
        *   Music playing from a radio.
        *   A character listening to music on headphones.
    *   **Ambient Sound/Roomtone:** Sounds that establish the environment or atmosphere of a location within the scene. This includes the faint, low hum of Deckard's apartment in *Blade Runner*. Location sounds also fit into this category.
*   **Purpose:** Diegetic sound helps to **enhance the realism** of the film's world, making it believable and immersive for the audience. It can also serve narrative functions, like planting a clue, creating atmosphere, or indicating character actions.

## Non-Diegetic Sound

*   **Definition:** Non-diegetic sounds are those that originate from **outside the story world** and are added for the audience's benefit. The characters in the story **cannot hear** these sounds. It is sometimes referred to as "pit" music in the context of classic film scores.
*   **Production:** Non-diegetic sounds are typically added in post-production by editors.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Underscore Music / Background Music / Scoring:** Music composed to accompany the film, setting moods, emphasising emotions, or providing narrative cues.
        *   The dark C minor synth string sounds in the *Blade Runner* sequence.
        *   The saxophone "Love Theme" in *Blade Runner*.
        *   Hans Zimmer's score for *Inception*.
        *   John Williams' iconic score for *Jaws*.
        *   The opening crawl music for *Star Wars*.
    *   **Narrative Voiceover / Narration:** A voice speaking over the action that isn't a character's thoughts or speech within the scene. Red's narration in *The Shawshank Redemption* is a classic example. While often non-diegetic, voiceover can sometimes be interpreted as diegetic if it represents a character's internal thoughts.
    *   **Sound Effects (Used for Effect):** Sound effects added purely for dramatic, comedic, or emotional impact, not necessarily originating from something on screen or heard by characters. Examples include:
        *   Stylised or abstract sound effects.
        *   The screeching violins in the shower scene of *Psycho*.
        *   An effect like a sudden increase in volume of background noise.
        *   Heartbeat sound effects used to heighten tension.
        *   A clock ticking sound effect used to build suspense.
*   **Purpose:** Non-diegetic sound is used to **guide the audience's emotional response**, build tension or suspense, provide narrative information or commentary, and create a cohesive sound unity. It helps interpret and illustrate narrative events.

## The Blurring Boundary

The sources highlight that the distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic sound is not always clear-cut and can become "slippery". Sounds can mutate or transition between categories within a scene, a phenomenon sometimes described as a "fantastical gap" or **trans-diegetic sound**.

*   The computer "peeping" sounds in *Blade Runner*, for instance, start as seemingly diegetic sound effects but transform and become part of the complex electronic underscore, blurring the line and helping to characterise Rachael.
*   Rachael's diegetic piano playing in *Blade Runner* combines with the non-diegetic synth strings and saxophone, creating a seamless soundscape where the distinction dissolves.
*   Sound effects can be added that feel external to the scene's reality but enhance its emotional impact, such as the non-diegetic screeching subway train sound effect in *The Godfather*.

This blurring is often a deliberate technique used in **sound design** (or *mise-en-bande*) to create a complex, layered, and immersive sonic experience. Electronic scores, like that of *Blade Runner*, are noted as particularly facilitating this mutation between sound effects and music.
