**Presentation Structure: Meaning in Music (Anthropological Perspectives)**

**Slide 1: Introduction - Understanding Meaning in Music**

- **Meaning in music** is fundamentally about how people **experience and think** about music.
- It involves individual experience translated into **thoughts and feelings**.
- While individual, meanings are of social science interest when **shared within a group**.
- The meaning of music is **broader than just musical sounds**, including non-musical associations.
- Understanding meaning helps explain **why people engage** with music and how musical **styles** develop.
- **Music is NOT a universal language**; understanding is selective and depends on **cultural context and individual experience**.
- Meaning is based on **individual perception** relating current experience to **previous experiences/memories** (association). This is why exotic music may lack meaning if we have no prior experience.
- Broadly **shared meanings motivate engagement** and contribute to understanding performance.

**Slide 2: Types of Meaning in Music**

- Music meaning is categorized into **three basic types**:
    - **Symbolic or Referential:** What music **says** or **refers to**. Music acts as a symbol for something else.
    - **Aesthetic:** Meaning found **within the music itself** (non-referential, absolute). Concerns what the sounds convey intrinsically.
    - **Pragmatic:** What music **does** (utilitarian). Used to obtain benefits; related to adaptive culture. _(Note: This type is a focus of a later chapter)_.

**Slide 3: Symbolic Meaning: Music as a Symbol**

- Human life is built on **symbols**, used in language, religion, and the arts. Music frequently serves as a symbol.
- A useful definition of symbol: **objects, acts, concepts** that **ambiguously stand for multiple meanings**, evoking emotions and impelling action. Music fits this (instruments are objects, production is an act).
- **Ambiguity** in musical meaning is key; the same music can hold **different meanings simultaneously** (multivocalic).
- This ambiguity allows for the **manipulation of symbolic meaning**, including denying or repudiating messages (repudiability). Examples include Shona political songs disguised with traditional symbols.

**Slide 4: Levels of Meaning & How Meaning is Determined**

- Meaning operates on **conscious (discursive), practical unconscious, and unconscious levels**.
- **Discursive meaning** can be verbally described.
- **Practical consciousness** meaning is felt or acted upon **without being consciously verbalised**. An outsider might infer it from behavior.
- Inability to verbalise meaning does not mean it doesn't exist, similar to grammar rules used by children who can't explain them.

**Slide 5: Combining Symbolic Meanings & Denotative Meaning**

- Meanings can be **combined** at different levels for complex symbolism.
    - **Motifs:** Basic recurring patterns assigned meaning (e.g., character themes in Prokofiev). Combining motifs builds complex meaning.
    - **Song Cycles:** Joined songs where each contributes to the overall meaning of an event (e.g., Australian Aboriginal ritual journeys).
- **Denotative meaning:** **Purposefully formulated** by the creator, usually **overt** and consciously understood by participants.

**Slide 6: Denotative Meaning: Iconicity and Arbitrary Symbols**

- Denotative meaning often works as an **icon**, where music **resembles** something else (iconicity). This includes **imitation** (aural representation of sounds). Examples: Drum = thunder, flute = bird calls, Chinese sona = phoenix. Resemblance can vary and may need learning.
- **Arbitrary symbolism** is **more common** than iconicity for denotative meaning. Meanings are learned through social agreement.
- Arbitrary meaning is often conveyed through **song lyrics**. Words and music have a **complementary relationship**.
- Instrumental music can carry arbitrary meaning through **association** (e.g., Wagnerian motifs for characters), **titles** (e.g., _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_), explanation (program notes), or **cultural convention** (e.g., African drum rhythms signifying events).
- Structures rarely carry complex _syntactic_ meaning like language, though exceptions exist (e.g., Tepehua "thought-songs" using rhythmic motifs for concepts).
- Meaning can be assigned to **modes** (e.g., Indian ragas, Javanese modes, Australian Aboriginal lineage identity) and **instruments** (e.g., Warlpiri bullroarers).
- Musical **structure** can function as **cues** to direct performance or inform listeners what is happening (e.g., Flathead drum taps, Kpelle vocal cues).

**Slide 7: Connotative Meaning**

- **Connotative meaning** is **inferred by the listener**, consciously or subconsciously.
- Operates through **situational experience** and **analogy**.
- **Situational meaning:** Music is linked to the **feelings of a past significant experience**. It's a result of mental association, not intentionally put into the music. Performance context provides clues. Examples: Lover's song, Shona songs changing meaning based on ritual context. Can be influenced by broader **political, religious, economic context** (e.g., Afghan view of music, Macedonian folk songs). Tuareg _tende_ drum symbolising social/cultural identity.

**Slide 8: Connotative Meaning: Analogy**

- **Analogy:** Perceiving **relationships/similarities** between music and other aspects of life/society. Can be conscious or unconscious. Less specific than imitation, like a subconscious icon.
- Music's structure can **resemble social conditions or life concepts**.
- Examples: Harmony in music vs. social harmony (Chinese). **Coherence** between musical forms and societal ideas (e.g., cycles in Indian/Javanese music reflecting worldviews, linearity/hierarchy in Western music/society, dualism in Suya songs/society, Aymara panpipe structure reflecting social organization). Analogical meaning related to **time** ("virtual time," "going down the road"). Binary oppositions in music reflecting worldview (Afghanistan).

**Slide 9: Metaphor**

- Metaphor is a type of meaning where **one symbol's meaning is extended** or understood through another symbol.
- Often involves a sound/performance functioning metaphorically to link to a **worldview or concept**, often with **emotional ties**.
- Examples: Chinese phoenix sound metaphor for warmth/sun. **Kaluli music** as a central metaphor for bird/spirit reflections of the dead, based on the myth of the muni bird and reciprocity. The descending musical pattern links to weeping and recalls the story, becoming a metaphor for grief and failure of sharing.

**Slide 10: Aesthetic Meaning**

- **Aesthetic meaning** is found **within the music itself**, independent of external reference or pragmatic use. Also called non-referential or absolute.
- Concerned with the **aesthetic qualities** of the music.
- While Western aesthetics often focused on "beauty," in anthropology, it refers to the **"qualitative feature... enhancement of experience and present enjoyment of the intrinsic qualities"**. Explicitly **excludes symbolic or pragmatic meanings**.
- Aesthetic appreciation is important in many societies outside the West, even if not verbally discussed (practical consciousness).

**Slide 11: Intrinsic Qualities, Affect, and Value**

- **Intrinsic qualities:** Features appreciated for their own sake, such as **tone quality, rhythmic patterns, melodies**. Similar to **style**.
- Key aesthetic issue: Is music valued for its **intrinsic qualities** or its effectiveness as a **symbol**?.
- **Affective qualities** (emotional response) are crucial. Affect stems from **symbolic, pragmatic, AND intrinsic** meanings. Aesthetic affect comes from appreciating valued intrinsic qualities.
- Societies value different intrinsic qualities: appreciating proficiency/clarity (Tuareg anzad players) versus valuing extraneous sounds like **buzzing** (Africa, Japan) or **shouts/cries** (Suya, also linked to participation).
- Appreciation of intrinsic qualities may not be verbally articulated, but indicated by reactions or discussions of musician merit.

**Slide 12: Creator vs. User Orientation & Sonic Design**

- Difference in value exists between the **creator orientation** (those who make music, appreciate skill/structure manipulation) and the **user orientation** (those who enjoy, may focus on lyrics/danceability). This distinction exists across societies.
- In stratified societies, different social strata have different musical values. Elite music often involves notation and discourse.
- **Sonic design:** The **deliberate arrangement of sounds** to create pleasing patterns (an important intrinsic quality). Distinguished from mere sonic order.
- Appreciation of sonic design is widespread, not just Western. Examples: Kaluli value "lift-up-over-sounding" and building "aesthetic tension" through musical features and skill.
- **Balance of unity and variety** is a potentially universal feature of valued sonic design. (Too little variety = boring; too much = noise).

**Slide 13: Affective Responses: Expectations (Meyer's Theory)**

- A significant potential **universal source of affect** relating to intrinsic qualities is based on **expectations**.
- Leonard Meyer's theory: Emotion arises from the listener's reaction to sounds, specifically **tension and release** related to **expectations** based on learned stylistic norms.
- Frustrated expectations lead to **heightened emotion**. Resolution of uncertainty brings pleasure.
- This theory applies to **non-Western music** and explains emotional reactions in societies without verbal discourse on musical structure, operating on an **unconscious level** (practical consciousness).
- Expectations are observed in various traditions (e.g., Javanese gamelan modal sequences, musical humor playing with incongruity).
- The consistency needed to create expectations suggests the importance of sonic design.

**Slide 14: Collaboration, Skill, and Legitimacy**

- **Collaboration** in performance can foster **strong emotional ties** and provide psycho-physiological gratification (potential universal affect/meaning).
- **Skill** in creating and performing is **highly valued**, likely universally, leading to heightened affect. Historically, "art" meant "skill". Skill involves working creatively within restrictions.
- **Legitimacy** (social acceptance/support) and **aesthetic quality** are related but **distinct**. Legitimized music may lack aesthetic quality, and vice versa.
- Music is legitimized for various reasons (spirit influence, profit, prestige), not solely aesthetic merit. Decisions can be made by people without musical understanding.
- High aesthetic achievement can be unrecognized outside legitimate channels.
- The "test of time" (music enduring) is an indicator of value, but the source of that value (symbolic, pragmatic, or aesthetic) may vary.
- Adding **complexity** by skilled musicians (e.g., in Jazz/Rock development) shows intrinsic qualities becoming valued.

**Slide 15: Conclusion: The Value of Meaning in Music**

- All types of meaning – **symbolic, pragmatic, and aesthetic** – can contribute to the **affective (emotional) power** of music.
- Music can be highly affective even without highly valued intrinsic qualities.
- The value placed on various types of meaning is ultimately **determined by society**.
- While debates about universal aesthetics continue, appreciation of **skill, unity/variety, and tension/release from expectations** are potential universal aspects of musical meaning and affect.
- In many societies, the **value of music** is often expressed primarily through its **function and use** in human life.
