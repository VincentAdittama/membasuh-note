[Slide: Title Slide - Chapter Five: Meaning in Music]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Hello everyone, and welcome to Chapter Five, where we dive into the fascinating world of 'Meaning in Music'. We've previously looked at how different societies _think_ about music, but now we're shifting gears. Today, we're exploring how individuals experience music, translate that experience into thoughts and feelings, and importantly, how these meanings become shared within a social group. Because, while musical meanings start with the individual, they become really interesting from a social science perspective when they're shared.

Now, the meaning of music is actually broader than just concepts _about_ music. Why? Because many of the meanings we attach to music aren't musical at all! These non-musical meanings can actually help us understand why people participate in musical events and how certain musical styles emerge.

You've probably heard music called a 'universal language,' haven't you? It sounds reasonable – music clearly _is_ an effective way to communicate. And it's true that music is universal; you won't find a human group anywhere without some form of music.

But here's where the analogy breaks down a bit. Just like spoken languages, you can't assume everyone will understand what music is communicating. Think about listening to music from a culture you know nothing about. It might feel meaningless, or even unpleasant. So, the idea that one form of music conveys the same meaning to everyone, or even _any_ meaning to all people, simply isn't true. Especially once you look beyond Western civilisation to places in Asia, Africa, or the Americas with indigenous music practices, it's clear that music, in that commonly understood sense, is _not_ a universal language.

Ultimately, the meaning we find in music is less about the music itself and more about **our individual perception**. We're constantly bombarded with sensory information, and we humans are very selective about what we pay attention to. That **focus of attention** is actually a primary feature of meaning. In a broad sense, if we don't react to something, it's essentially meaningless _to us_.

Meaning also involves our **affective reactions** – how we feel about something. These reactions can range from just casually noticing something to being moved to tears or laughter. Traditionally, meaning has been linked to **symbols**, but for a truly expressive cultural element like music, we also need to consider the **aesthetic dimension**, which connects those feelings and emotions to a society's **values**."

[Slide: Continuation of Meaning in Music, introducing types of meaning]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"So, how do we actually find meaning? Generally, it happens when we **connect something we're experiencing now with past experiences** stored in our memory. This creates a form of **association**, which is why most meanings are very **personal**.

This is also why we might not appreciate some types of music from other cultures – we simply **lack the previous experience** needed to connect with it. Think about how a particular song might become incredibly meaningful to you because you heard it during a really important moment in your life, maybe a sad one or a joyful one. That meaning is unique to your personal experience.

But, as we grow up, we absorb the skills for understanding music from our society, as well as the meanings our society attaches to it. So, many elements of musical meaning _are_ shared among people in the same society, based on their shared symbols and values. These **broadly shared musical meanings** are actually the driving force behind organising musical events and performing music.

Now, the sources tell us there are basically **three main types of meaning** in music:

1. First, there's **symbolic or referential meaning**. This is when music acquires meaning because of **what it _says_ or _refers_ to**. It points to something outside of itself.
2. Second, we have **aesthetic meaning**. This is also called **non-referential or absolute meaning**. This type is all about **what the music _is_** – the sounds themselves – without referencing anything outside of the music.
3. And finally, there's **pragmatic meaning**. In many societies, music is used for **utilitarian benefits**. Pragmatic meaning is about **what the music _does_**. It's more connected to the practical, 'adaptive' aspects of culture than the 'expressive' ones.

We'll be focusing on the **symbolic and aesthetic** meanings in this chapter, while pragmatic uses will be covered elsewhere.

Moving on, the text talks about **Music as Symbol**. Symbols are fundamental to human life. They're the foundation of language, allowing us to pass knowledge down through generations. Symbols are also key in religion, helping us grapple with big questions about life's meaning. And they are absolutely crucial in the arts. The arts are central to enjoying life and maintaining emotional stability. Only humans have this complex ability to symbolise in language, religion, and the arts."

[Slide: Music as Symbol - Defining Symbol and its application to Music]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Defining 'symbol' isn't easy because the word is used in so many ways. The sources mention a useful view from Charles S. Peirce, who saw symbols as just _one_ of three kinds of signs.

- An **index**, for Peirce, has a **physical connection** between the sign and what it means. Think of thunder – it's an index because it physically signals a storm.
- An **icon** is a sign that has some kind of **resemblance** to what it means. A drum rolling to imitate thunder? That's an icon. When music imitates something, it's often called **iconicity**.
- Peirce's 'symbol' (what he called 'arbitrary symbol') has a **completely arbitrary relationship** between the sign and its meaning. Flags signalling a storm, or most words in language, are symbols in this narrow sense.

Now, Peirce's view is a bit specific. In a more popular sense, a symbol is just **anything that stands for something else**. The sources use Peirce's idea to help distinguish index and icon, suggesting his 'symbol' is less confusingly called 'arbitrary symbol'.

Music often acts as a symbol because it **can convey meanings about many other things**. A really useful definition for thinking about musical symbols is from Cohen: symbols are '**objects, acts, concepts or linguistic formations that stand ambiguously for a multiplicity of disparate meanings, evoke sentiments and emotions, and impel men to action**'.

Why does music fit this? Musical instruments and sound waves are objects; making music is an act. Since music is such an important symbol, creating music is seen as a form of **symbolic behavior**.

A key part of meaning in music comes from its **ambiguity**. The same piece or performance can hold **different meanings at the same time**. Symbols that carry multiple meanings like this are sometimes called **multivocalic**.

This ambiguity is actually powerful. It allows people to **manipulate symbolic meanings** for their own purposes. One way this happens is through **repudiability** – the potential to deny or disown the meanings expressed, especially if they might cause trouble, embarrassment, or political issues."

**Page 4**

[Slide: Repudiability, Expression vs. Communication, Levels of Consciousness]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"A great example of repudiability comes from the Shona people in Zimbabwe. Many of their political songs, used during their uprising against European colonialists, could be explained innocently by referring to traditional beliefs about animals. A song literally meaning 'we are playing with the chief's little bird' had a deep political meaning related to spirit mediums coordinating resistance in the 1890s and 1970s. But if asked, you could easily avoid giving that true, deeper explanation.

While music as a symbol is _expected_ to convey meaning, sometimes it functions purely as **self-expression** without necessarily communicating. The terms 'expression' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they're distinct.

- **Expression** is simply putting thoughts or feelings into a medium. Whether someone else gets the message isn't necessary for it to be expression.
- **Communication** involves **two parties** – a sender and a receiver – and a message passing between them.

When musicians are focused only on giving form to their feelings, they're expressing. If that expression doesn't mean anything to anyone else, it's just expression. But if the expression _does_ carry meaning to someone else, then it becomes both expression and communication. Sometimes, the meaning the listener gets isn't the one the sender intended, leading to **distorted communication**. Because symbols in the arts are so ambiguous, the sender might have a range of possible meanings, and any of them could result in communication if the receiver picks it up. Messages can be about ideas (which we process using **cognition**) or feelings (which relate to **affect**).

Meaning in music exists on different levels of consciousness. There's **discursive consciousness**, where you can actually describe the meaning to someone else. And then there's **practical consciousness**, where meaning is present but you're not consciously aware of it.

If a society doesn't verbalise certain meanings, it doesn't necessarily mean those meanings aren't there. Often, an **outside observer** can figure out these meanings by analysing the group's behavior. The observer doesn't have the same assumptions that might blind the people participating. It's a bit like how young children can speak grammatically perfect sentences but can't explain the rules of grammar – their inability to verbalise doesn't mean the rules don't exist or that they aren't following them."

[Slide: Combining Meanings, Song Cycles, Aborigine Example]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Another interesting aspect of symbolism in music is how **meanings can be combined**. When the meanings of several symbols are put together, the total meaning can be different from the individual parts. This combining can happen at different levels.

The most basic level is the **motif**. A motif is a foundational pattern of melody and rhythm that keeps coming back throughout a piece. A classic example is in Prokofiev's _Peter and the Wolf_, where each character has a specific theme or motif. When the animals walk together, their individual themes are combined musically, creating a more complex symbol representing their gathering.

Building on this, some music traditions link different songs together to form **song cycles**. This is a form of symbolism seen with the Australian Aborigines, particularly in rituals tied to their Dreamtime myths. They use these song cycles to tell the story of ancient mythical journeys. Each song in the cycle represents a specific stop on the journey. So, each song has its own meaning, but it also contributes to the **overall meaning of the entire ritual event**. These songs are carefully coordinated with the sections of the ritual as the journey is acted out.

The sources give us an example of one such song cycle, tracing the path of a spirit-agent from one location to another, singing about what they saw or experienced at each stop."

**Page 6**

[Slide: Denotative vs. Connotative Meaning, Iconic Meaning]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"The example of the Aborigine song cycle continues here, detailing the journey. This helps us see how music can operate as a symbol. To make this clearer, we can distinguish two main ways music conveys meaning: **denotative** and **connotative**.

- **Denotative meaning** is meaning that is **purposefully built into the music** by the people creating it. Because it's intentional, this meaning is usually **overt** and exists in the **discursive consciousness** of the **participants** – they know and can talk about what it means.
- **Connotative meaning**, on the other hand, is **inferred by the listener** based on their **experience** with the music. This meaning often arises from **practical consciousness** – it's felt or understood subconsciously.

The line between denotative and connotative meaning isn't always sharp, but understanding the difference gives us a way to think about the many ways music conveys meaning.

Now, denotative meaning can operate as an **icon**. This is when the sounds of the music have a **resemblance to something else** in reality. This iconicity can take the form of **imitation** or **analogy**.

When music imitates other sounds – like a drum sounding like thunder or a flute like a bird – it's a kind of aural picture. The resemblance can vary a lot, and sometimes you need to _learn_ the connection. While the resemblance between a drum and thunder might seem obvious, the meaning could be missed if the sound is deliberately distorted for style.

- In Japanese kabuki theatre, a drumbeat representing water (_mizuoto_) is actually quite arbitrary – it doesn't sound much like water.
- But a more complex drumbeat for waves (_namioto_) _is_ iconic; it has a surging intensity that resembles waves.
- Japanese shakuhachi flute music can imitate the mating cry of a hart.
- Chinese sona can represent the sound of the mythical phoenix bird.
- Many small societies imitate animal sounds.
- And in Western classical music, composers often use sound to depict things like storms."

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Here are some examples from the sources illustrating those iconic instruments. On the top, we have the Shakuhachi, the Japanese flute mentioned for imitating a hart's cry. And below, the Chinese Sona, used to represent the phoenix bird."

**Page 8**

[Slide: Arbitrary Symbolism, Music with Texts, Instrumental Music]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Beyond iconicity, **arbitrary symbolism** is a more common type of denotative meaning in music. In this sense, musical meanings are similar to the meanings of words in language. We learn to recognise these arbitrary meanings in music in various ways.

The clearest and perhaps most important way is through the **words or lyrics of a song**. Vocal music is more common globally than purely instrumental music. Often, the symbolism and meaning of the musical sounds are closely tied to, and even depend on, the text. Words and music frequently have a **complementary relationship**: the text provides the specific message, and the music **intensifies the appropriate feelings**. While studying song texts is like literary study, this chapter focuses on how music has meaning _apart_ from the words.

Instrumental music by itself rarely carries very specific denotative meanings, but it _can_ be made to. Just like words, musical **motifs can be given arbitrary denotative meanings** and then combined. Think of Richard Wagner and other opera composers who give specific motifs to characters or elements of the story. You learn the meaning of these motifs by associating them with the character's appearance.

The sources mention the Piaroa Indians of Venezuela, where different supernatural beings have their own motifs heard during rituals as they enter the sacred house. In parts of Africa, specific drum rhythms have conventional, arbitrary meanings, letting people know what kind of event is happening when they hear them."

**Page 9**

[Slide: Syntactic Meaning, Arbitrary Meanings in Society, Drumming, Modes]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Music structures don't usually convey complex meaning in the way language syntax does. However, the sources highlight a case from Charles L. Boiles with the Tepehua people in Mexico, where the meaning of the music _is_ syntactic. Here, several musical symbols are combined to create a larger musical meaning.

The Tepehua use violin and guitar in 'thought-songs' during ceremonies focused on community well-being. Different songs go with different parts of the ritual, and the music itself tells people what's happening. Boiles' analysis shows how rhythmic patterns and intervals are combined and given specific meanings. For example, certain patterns mean 'sacrifice' or 'asking pardon'. A specific pattern might refer to an 'intercessor'. The size and direction of intervals add meaning, and repeating the same pitch indicates a place.

While this semantic structure is limited compared to language, it shows music _can_ have semantic meaning through the combination of these elements.

Often, arbitrary meanings in music, like those Tepehua songs, are understood simply because they are **widely known within a society**. In societies with lots of instrumental music, there are often ways to teach members what meanings specific pieces convey. The meanings might be known by the whole community and passed down through explanation or experience. In Western society, things like program notes at concerts or titles of instrumental pieces serve a similar purpose.

Drumming, particularly in Africa, is a powerful example of conveying arbitrary meanings. It's not just accompaniment; it's a full musical language on its own. Drums can have complex patterns of rhythm, timbre, and pitch. In areas with tonal languages, the pitch of drums can even **reproduce the tones of language**, allowing them to convey linguistic messages. This is the basis of the famous 'talking drums' used for long-distance communication in places like Zaire. Drumming can also be used for social commentary.

Meaning isn't just in rhythms and melodies; it's also assigned to **modes** or tonal systems. The ragas of India have specific modes considered suitable for different times of day. Javanese music also uses specific modes for various times. The Australian Aborigines, once thought to have 'primitive' music due to a narrow tonal range, actually used different modes to identify songs of specific lineages, showing a complex symbolic system."

[Slide: Meaning in Instruments, Cues in Performance]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Just as music structure and patterns have meaning, so do the **instruments themselves**. The Warlpiri people use large and small bullroarers in a fertility ritual. As objects, the bullroarers symbolise the elder and younger sisters. The sounds they make also carry meaning – the larger low-pitched sound represents the Two Mothers, and the smaller high-pitched sound represents evil spirits.

Interestingly, the sources note that flutes and other long, thin instruments are often given iconic meaning due to their resemblance to male genitalia, although this symbolism can be overlooked by some groups.

Meaning in music also functions as **cues**. These are signals that **direct the course of a performance** or help the listener understand what's happening.

- Among the Flathead Indians, a lead singer cues the tempo by tapping their fingers on the drum edge. They signal the approaching end of a War Dance song by halving the beat and increasing intensity.
- Among the Kpelle in West Africa, a singer can cue the chorus entry with a descending melodic line, reducing the text, or using specific vowels like 'ee' or 'oo'. These cues can be used alone or combined to avoid confusion.

These kinds of cues are particularly important in group performances where improvisation is involved."

**Page 11**

[Slide: Connotative Meaning - Situational Experience]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Now let's move on to **connotative meaning**. This meaning is perceived by the listener, sometimes consciously, sometimes not, and it's _not_ something the musician necessarily put there intentionally.

Connotative meaning works in two main ways: through **situational experience** and **analogy**.

**Situational meaning** happens when hearing music that was part of a **significant past experience causes you to recall the feelings** associated with that original event. A very common example is when a particular song becomes 'your song' with a partner, carrying special significance because you first heard it during a meaningful moment together. This kind of meaning is a result of **mental association** and isn't something deliberately built into the musical performance itself.

This is why careful analysis of the **performance context** is so important in understanding musical meaning – it often provides clues about the meaning that comes from the situation. These clues are similar to program notes about a composer's state of mind, but they come from informal social interactions rather than specific written information.

Situational meaning can even affect how song types are categorised. The sources mention how older Shona people might know a song as a 'hunting song' because that's where they first heard it, but younger people might identify the same song as a 'spirit possession song' because that's the ritual where it's still performed. The meaning for each group depends on their experience and the performance context.

Importantly, situational meaning isn't limited to the immediate event. The **broader political, religious, or economic context of a society** can shape the meaning of a musical performance. For example, in Afghanistan, the idea that music is linked to heat contributes to the view that it's dangerous or immoral."

---

**Page 12**

[Slide: Situational Meaning and Societal Context, Analogy]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Another powerful example of context shaping meaning comes from folk songs in Macedonia about fighting the Turks. Older people who lived through that time associated the songs with the sadness of loss and oppression. But younger people who hadn't experienced those conditions saw the same songs as happy, depicting bravery and freedom.

The Tuareg tende mortar drum offers several layers of situational symbolism related to the social context. The term 'tende' refers to both the drum and the musical events where it's played. Since it only appeared in the 20th century, it symbolises both the nobility and people of lower status, and represents traditional life versus modernization. Among different Tuareg groups, the noble prefer the anzad lute as a symbol of their status, but they use the tende with other groups to affirm their shared Tuareg identity – it's become their 'true folk music'.

The second way connotative meaning arises is through **analogy**. This happens when an individual notices a relationship between **similar types of phenomena**. Analogy is a very common way humans think; it's like a subconscious form of iconicity, but less specific than direct imitation.

When music carries meaning through analogy, it's because its **structures resemble aspects of society or human life** in general. This is linked to the idea of **intersense transfer**. A frequent analogy is between **harmony in music and harmony in society**. This was so significant to the ancient Chinese that they had a government department dedicated to music. They saw noise versus music as being like chaos versus an ordered society."

---

**Page 13**

[Slide: Coherence - Music Reflecting Society/Life]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"The human tendency to appreciate similar forms – analogy – is thought to be a major reason why there's often **coherence between musical forms and concepts about life or the structure of society**. Because we often perceive these similarities unconsciously, it's considered a feature of **practical consciousness**.

A widely known example of this **coherence** is in India. The Hindu concept of reincarnation views life as an endless cycle. Classical Indian music is also based on cycles, reinforcing this fundamental idea. In Java, cycles traditionally symbolised calmness and serenity, and the elongated cycles in court music reflected the importance of stability in both society and musical structure. In contrast, Western society often focuses on the **linear** aspects of life – birth, growth, death – and Western music tends to be linear, building to a climax and then tapering off.

Another suggested case of coherence in Western society is the way the hierarchical structure of society is reflected in the hierarchy of a modern symphony orchestra and its audience.

Now, demonstrating conclusively that these forms of coherence directly contribute to meaning is tricky, but more and more cases suggest the idea has validity.

Coherence also appears as **dualism**, where aspects of life are divided into two parts. The Suya people, like many Amazonian societies, divide their community and many parts of their lives this way. Their ceremonies feature two divisions of the community (moieties), and their shout songs have two halves, sung by each moiety. This dualism even extends to how they think about song – distinguishing shout songs ('small throat') from unison songs ('big throat').

In the Peruvian highlands, the Aymara community of Conima shows coherence between their musical behaviour and social life. Panpipe ensembles play at fiestas, divided into high, medium, and low pipes. Unlike European music where soprano and bass are key, they value the **middle voice** most. This pattern – giving primary importance to the **center** and developing outward – parallels their Andean weaving and their concept of social organization, where a central community supports peripheral ones at different altitudes. This reflects their adaptation to life on the mountainside."

---

**Page 14**

[Slide: Coherence and Egalitarianism, Analogy and Time, Binary Oppositions]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Coherence has also been suggested among the Mbuti Pygmies. Their highly **egalitarian** society is mirrored in their musical activities. What Westerners hear as singing (lullabies, play songs) is considered by Mbuti as just 'sound,' not 'song'. For the Mbuti, truly legitimate music _must_ involve **group participation**. Singing in hocket and avoiding soloists expresses their commitment to group values.

The sources note that not all egalitarian societies have this kind of 'groupy' music, suggesting other factors are important elsewhere. But it doesn't necessarily invalidate the idea of coherence for the Mbuti.

Some analogical meaning might be entirely unconscious, relating to basic human experience rather than just specific societal experience. **Time** is one such area. Music fundamentally exists in time. One scholar, Blacking, described music as creating a 'world of virtual time', suggesting it's like a miniature model of how time passes in human life. In music, we can experience the working out of plans or processes in moments, something that takes months or years in real life. And we have a sense of control over time in music, which we often lack in reality.

However, the analogy of time isn't the same for everyone. The Kpelle of Liberia, for example, see time in music as 'going down the road'. For them, it's not just about the _passage_ of time, but the _quality_ of the experience moment-to-moment, like meeting people as you walk.

Some societies take analogy further by structuring their view of reality around **binary oppositions** – sets of opposites. When music is included in these oppositions, it shows how music is integrated with other meanings in that society."

---

**Page 15**

[Slide: Binary Oppositions Example, Metaphor]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Here's an example from Sakata, who presented a set of binary oppositions from Persian-speaking areas of Afghanistan. These oppositions reveal insights into how music and musicians are conceptualised:

- Music is opposed to Literature.
- Foreign is opposed to Native.
- Professional to Amateur.
- Instrumental to Vocal.
- Urban to Rural.
- Male to Female.
- Formal to Informal.
- Specific to General.
- Segregation to Nonsegregation.
- Censure to Praise.
- Variety of Styles to Lack of Variety of Styles.
- Terminology Abundance to Lack of Terminology.

Looking at these pairs gives us a snapshot of the underlying structure of how music is understood in that cultural context.

Next, the sources discuss **metaphor**. A metaphor often combines two types of meaning. It's essentially when the meaning of one symbol becomes _another_ symbol, **extending the original meaning**. The term originally came from language, where a word's meaning was extended based on resemblance.

Here's a slightly silly analogy provided: the sounds 't-u-r-k-e-y' are a symbol for the bird. Because turkeys are seen as stupid, the bird itself becomes an icon for stupidity. When you call a person a 'turkey,' the sounds and the bird symbol combine to become a metaphor for a stupid person. The term 'metaphor' literally means 'beyond the bearer of meaning'.

When we talk about music as a metaphor, we often overlook the word-origin link. So, referring to music as a metaphor might sometimes be more accurately described as analogy.

However, the sources give a clear example of music as metaphor. The phoenix bird imitation in Chinese music isn't just about the bird; the phoenix is the greatest bird, symbolising the sun and warmth. The sound imitates the bird (iconicity), but the bird representing the ruler of the south/sun/warmth is a meaning known in Chinese society. Together, the sound of the bird **symbolising the warmth of the sun** creates a metaphor."

**Page 16**

[Slide: Metaphor - Kaluli Gisaro Ceremony]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"This image shows a Kaluli man dancing in the gisaro ceremony. The Kaluli people of New Guinea provide another powerful example of music as metaphor, deeply linked to their worldview. They believe that when people die, their spirits live on in birds, so birds are seen as **'spirit reflections' of the dead**. Because of this belief, they don't hunt birds near their homes. When birds sing, they hear it as the **voices of the dead** speaking.

Several dove species in their environment have calls with a descending pitch pattern. This descending pattern becomes a **basis for much Kaluli song**.

Central to this metaphor is a myth about a boy who became a _muni_ bird. The boy was refused food by his older sister. Food sharing and reciprocity are extremely important values for the Kaluli, so the boy felt abandoned and transformed into a bird. The song of the _muni_ bird, based on that descending pattern, has become the foundation for their most important and moving song form: the **gisaro**.

You can see that descending note pattern here."

---

**Page 17**

[Slide: Descending Pitch Notation, Music as Aesthetic]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"This simple musical notation shows the descending notes. This pattern is used in weeping, often with words added. As the text becomes more elaborate, the weeping transforms into song.

This song becomes a deeply moving **metaphor**. It resembles the sound of the _muni_ bird, which immediately brings to mind the story of the failure of sharing and reciprocity. By including the names of specific people and places, the singer can make the song a reference to particular dead loved ones, as if those bird-spirits were speaking.

Now, let's shift gears and talk about **Music as Aesthetic**. We might have used the term 'aesthetic' before, assuming a common understanding. But it's time to look at it more closely.

Remember symbolic meaning refers to things _outside_ the music. **Aesthetic meaning**, also called **absolute or nonreferential**, is found **within the music itself**, without referring to anything external. Music isn't _always_ an aesthetic experience, but you can't fully grasp musical meaning without considering its potential aesthetic qualities.

**Aesthetics** is a branch of philosophy concerned with evaluating value. In Western philosophy, it traditionally focused on concepts of **beauty**. More recently, it's expanded to include the overall value given to the 'fine arts'. So, today, 'aesthetic' often refers to the value assigned by the **elite**, which might include symbolic or pragmatic values, not just beauty. However, in this chapter, 'aesthetic' is used in its older, narrower sense, related to beauty."

**Page 18**

[Slide: Cross-Cultural Aesthetics, Intrinsic Qualities, Tuareg Example]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"When we study how people in other societies value their music, we can't assume they only care about symbolic or pragmatic uses; aesthetic features are often very important. An Indian musician's aesthetic, for instance, is described as their 'set of values about music itself'. To understand this holistically, we need to explore how relevant aesthetic qualities are to musical meaning outside the West. Aesthetic appreciation might be a form of **practical consciousness** that we need to discover through observation.

When researching this, we need a specific definition of 'aesthetic' that might differ from Western philosophy. Cross-cultural researchers have tried to find concepts similar to 'beauty' in non-Western societies, but it's been difficult because many cultures don't have a single word with the same broad meaning.

Anthropologist Warren L. d'Azevedo defined aesthetic as the '**qualitative feature of the event involving the enhancement of experience and the present enjoyment of the intrinsic qualities of things**'. This definition is useful because it includes beauty but also allows for other types of **intrinsic qualities** that other societies might value. Crucially, d'Azevedo's definition **excludes symbolic or pragmatic meanings** tied to non-musical experience.

**Intrinsic qualities** in music are features like **tone quality, rhythmic patterns, or melodies** that are appreciated purely for their own sake. They are similar to what we call 'style'. However, style can also carry symbolic or pragmatic meanings. The key aesthetic question is whether a style is valued _because of its intrinsic qualities_ or because it symbolises some non-musical relationship.

We can see this distinction in the reactions to anzad players among the Tuareg. One player, Ajo, was highly praised. When asked why, listeners used terms like 'soul,' 'taste,' or comparing it to 'food with salt' – suggesting a vital ingredient was present. They noted her repertoire and tone clarity. They agreed her technique was good but not the _only_ requirement for superior playing. Their observation showed specific moments were particularly affecting, like when she emphasised a certain interval. Listeners would gasp and sigh with pleasure.

Ajo herself seemed aware of this effect and used her culture's musical material skillfully."

---

**Page 19**

[Slide: Contrasting Reactions, Problems in Cross-Cultural Study of Aesthetics]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Here we see Ajo playing the anzad lute.

The case of Ajo beautifully illustrates the difference between appreciating the **intrinsic quality** of the music and reacting based on **symbolic meaning**. Some listeners enjoyed the music's internal features. But others reacted based on what Ajo's style symbolised. A young noble preferred another player using an older style, which symbolised the old way of life he missed. Another player disliked Ajo's style because it sounded like vassal women, not noble women. So, appreciating the augmented fourth was an aesthetic reaction to an intrinsic quality, but reacting based on yearning for the past or class distinctions came from symbolic connections to life experiences. The sources point out it's confusing to call values unrelated to the music's intrinsic qualities 'aesthetic'. Like the young people in Macedonia who care about what's 'in' rather than what's beautiful.

Figuring out the basis of aesthetic response in other societies is challenging. It's more than just asking people what they value. We need to distinguish between **aesthetic discourse** (talking _about_ aesthetics, common in the West) and **aesthetic practice** (engaging in aesthetic activities, even without talking about them). Many societies don't have formal discourse about musical values. Aesthetic creativity and response can be part of **practical consciousness** – happening without being verbalised. So, it's wrong to assume intrinsic qualities don't cause feelings just because people aren't discussing them.

There are clues to discovering a society's value system. For instance, if a musical rendition is presented as a 'performance,' it likely has highly valued features. That value could be symbolic, pragmatic, or intrinsic. Discussing the relative merits of musicians can also reveal the value placed on intrinsic qualities. The **critic's role** is important here in understanding different societies' **musical value systems**.

A key problem in studying aesthetics cross-culturally is that researchers often start with **Western criteria**. These include things like:

- **Psychic distance:** a sense of contemplation or detachment.
- **Nonutilitarian goals:** the music isn't purely for practical use.
- **Presence of affect:** it evokes emotion.
- **Elements of design:** its structure and organisation are valued.

It's not clear how much these apply to non-Western systems. Psychic distance might be more about discourse than experience. Though in the Kalabari masquerades, masks focus attention on performance quality, suggesting something similar to contemplating intrinsic qualities."

[Slide: Utilitarian Goals and Aesthetic Elements, Values and Affect]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Even when music has practical, **utilitarian goals**, aesthetic elements can be added. In visual arts, aesthetic features aren't necessary for the object's use. It's easier to see this with a pot than a ritual dance. Music performed to influence spirits or display prestige has other goals, but **qualities that go _beyond_ what's needed for that purpose** can be considered aesthetic. These are hard to define and measure. But things like adding variations or increasing intensity can signal an appreciation of intrinsic qualities, even if people don't say so.

Now, let's talk about **Values and Affect**. Western aesthetics connects the aesthetic experience to **emotional or affective reactions**. This is part of what d'Azevedo called the '**enhancement of experience**'.

However, affect in music isn't just about intrinsic qualities. It's also linked to **symbolic** and **pragmatic meanings**. Symbolic meanings often represent things society **values**. When music is used in important rituals, like for curing or ensuring good crops, the emotions tied to the success or failure of those goals get transferred to the music. So, emotion in music can come from music symbolising something highly valued. Analogical meanings linking music to society or life can also heighten affect. Aesthetic affect, specifically, comes from being aware of **valued qualities _within_ the music** itself. A single performance can have multiple meanings causing different types of affect.

Questions of value are key to understanding human emotional responses. We tend to feel emotional about what we value, especially when we achieve it or are denied it. Many values are determined by society, so our emotional responses are tied to our society's **legitimised values**. 'Beauty' has even been defined as something that causes affect because it achieves goals valued by society. While basic human psychology might cause affect from intrinsic qualities, **most affective features of music are shaped by the sociocultural system**.

The sources contrast value ideals between East Asia and Western civilisation. The West values personality, independence, and originality in art. The East values the school, the perfect example of a type."

[Slide: Intrinsic Qualities Inducing Affect, Creator vs. User Orientation]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"The **intrinsic qualities** that create affect also differ across societies. Many cultures value 'noise' that Westerners might dislike. In Africa, a **buzzing** sound from rattles or vibrating membranes is deliberately added to instruments. This buzzing intensifies the sound, prolonging it, and is considered **emotionally satisfying**; the music doesn't feel right without it. Japanese music values noise mixed with pure tone, seen in the breathy sounds of the shakuhachi.

The Suya of Brazil provide another example. They value performances that lead to euphoria, a kind of 'high'. A key part of this is **full participation**, which they see as essential for the performance to be considered 'beautiful' and for people to feel euphoric. If people were silent or absent, it was considered 'ugly' and 'emotionless'. Their main value was social participation, and this was felt through adding 'shouts, cries, weeping, and animal sounds' to the music – sounds Westerners might see as extraneous. The value was the social act, experienced through the totality of the sound.

Values for intrinsic qualities aren't just different between societies; they also differ within complex societies among different **taste publics** (high culture vs. popular culture).

Another significant difference in values exists between the **creator orientation** and the **user orientation**.

- The **creator orientation** belongs to people with the knowledge and practice to **make music**. They appreciate the challenges of creation and find solving musical problems exciting.
- The **user orientation** belongs to the **audience or consumers** who enjoy the music but might not know much about how it's made. They might value lyrics or danceability more than the creative process itself."

[Slide: Creator vs. User in Different Societies, Legitimate vs. Aesthetic Music]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"People with a creator orientation also apply their criteria to evaluating others' performances. The distinction isn't always clear-cut; users can certainly learn to appreciate the creative process, which is the goal of things like music appreciation courses. For example, music education in India teaches theory and practice to make listeners informed and sympathetic.

Many creators also consider the user's perspective and create music with their values in mind. Even in societies where most music is communal, some individuals are more talented or interested in performance and tend to have stronger emotional reactions to the intrinsic qualities of the music.

This difference was seen with Shona mbira music. The regular players knew many songs, improvised skillfully, and could discuss the musical merits of different performers (creator orientation). Users typically just danced; they couldn't discuss the music itself and evaluated players based on kinship or religious factors. Some users, unaware of the skill involved, were even impressed by amateur performances.

In small, nonstratified societies, the creator/user distinction might be the _only_ difference in musical values. But in stratified societies, different social strata are likely to have varying values regarding music. Music considered **legitimate** by the elite might include **notation**, formal writings about it, and restrictions on who can perform it. However, music that isn't legitimized by the elite can still have **intrinsic qualities** that are highly valued by other taste publics. So, just because music is considered legitimate doesn't automatically mean it's aesthetic.

Performance criteria also vary. In Western music, hitting the **correct pitch** is paramount. Variations in rhythm are common. In Africa, maintaining the **rhythm** without stopping is far more important than exact pitch. **Timbre** or tone quality is also valued, but what's considered 'correct' differs – compare the pinched singing of Asia to the open singing in Europe and Africa."

[Slide: Sonic Design, Kaluli Example, Unity and Variety, Math Link]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"In Western aesthetics, **structure or design** is seen as a crucial intrinsic quality. A single musical tone only gets meaning from the tones around it; they become music when they're related. This **sonic order** is what separates music from noise. **Sonic design** is the deliberate arrangement of sounds to create pleasing patterns. It's the creative element beyond basic sonic order. A research goal is to see if this value for sonic design is universal or culturally specific. Some think it's valued everywhere; others think if people don't talk about it, they don't value it.

Evidence suggests appreciation for sonic design _is_ widespread. Some non-Western groups value features of musical design. The Kaluli, whose songs are based on the metaphor of birds as spirits, highly value music's ability to move people to tears. While this involves association and context, their concept of 'lift-up-over-sounding' refers to the **quality of the sound patterns themselves**.

The Kaluli also talk about building '**an aesthetic tension**'. They call it _halaido domeki_, or 'hardening' a song. This involves making the text stronger (more vivid imagery, verbs) and 'hardening' the musical features – increasing voice intensity, adding a chorus, using skillful improvisation. When Feld recorded a Kaluli lament, they found its construction controlled, deliberate, and crafted, like a composed piece, yet it felt spontaneous. This ability to express deep feeling within a structured, improvised form was found very powerful, leading them to ask for playback.

A feature of sonic design with potential cross-cultural relevance is the **balance of unity and variety**. Music with too little unity and too much variety sounds like noise. Music with too much unity and not enough variety can be boring, unless it has significant non-musical meaning. Inuit drum dance songs balance this well, shifting between free and strict sections, creating a strong aesthetic effect. Although the Inuit might not verbalise this, these songs remain popular.

In the West, the link between structure and aesthetics connects to the historical link between music and **mathematics** since ancient Greece. Scales and rhythms were based on mathematical relationships. Today, this historical link might be seen as an early attempt to give musicians legitimacy. 'Aesthetic music' is often seen as complex, requiring skill from both performer and listener. This might reflect elite norms legitimizing certain music types. Western aesthetic appreciation for sonic design might be linked to discourse about structural values, perhaps tied to patronage."

[Slide: Affective Qualities and Meyer's Theory of Expectation]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"While many affective qualities in music are cultural, some emotional reactions might be **universal**, stemming from human cognitive and affective processes. Cross-cultural research looks for universal emotional responses to intrinsic qualities.

Leonard R. Meyer's theory in _Emotion and Meaning in Music_ is useful here. His theory focuses on affect from the **musical sound itself**, without external references. According to Meyer's **theory of expectations**, affect is caused by the listener experiencing **uncertainty** as the music unfolds, especially when it doesn't meet their learned expectations. The resolution of this uncertainty produces an emotional reaction. Meyer sees this as a significant cause of affect, though not the only one.

Meyer's theory is based on human psychology. We have a strong drive to create structures and patterns from our experiences; we dislike chaos. As we grow, we build mental models of the musical styles we hear. Our memory simplifies these, creating models with continuity. But actual music can be ambiguous or deviate from these models. When our expectations are frustrated, it leads to heightened emotion. Emotion is a general physiological state, and the _type_ of emotion depends on the stimulus. Music elicits pleasure when we believe the uncertainty is under control and will be resolved, which we assume if the musicians are competent.

Meyer's theory is important because it applies beyond Western music. He shows how it fits other traditions, like melodic ornamentation in Asia interrupting continuity or improvisation highlighting discontinuity. Indian musicians might deviate from the basic structure before returning.

Crucially, this theory isn't limited to intellectual aesthetic analysis. Meyer says the affect from delayed expectation works on an **unconscious level**, in our practical consciousness. This explains emotional reactions to musical structure in societies that don't have formal discussions about music theory."

[Slide: Expectations in Other Societies, Musical Humor, Collaboration, Skill]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Meyer also draws a parallel between the suspense in music and suspense in life. This analogy to life can unconsciously add to the emotional impact.

The operation of expectations is seen in other cultures. Javanese gamelan listeners associate melodic patterns with expectations. Meeting those expectations brings pleasure. A small deviation can enhance pleasure, but a big one is annoying.

Expectations are key to **musical humor**. Incongruous resolutions of expectations are funny. The Blackfoot create humor by mixing styles to create incongruity. Peter Schickele's PDQ Bach uses distorted expectations for comedy, like blending national anthems with unexpected tunes. Inept performances can also be humorous by playing with expectations.

Expectation and resolution are like **tension and release**. While societies create tension differently, the basic process Meyer describes is similar across cultures. Musical consistency creates expectation, making sonic design seem important, not just in 'serious' music. Using the term 'aesthetic' can help avoid associating quality only with elite music.

Another possible universal source of **affect** is **collaboration**. When people perform music together, interpersonal relationships develop, leading to strong emotional ties. Performing requires coordinating with others, sometimes setting aside your own desires for the group. This is a paradox in human life. This act of _sublimating_ individual autonomy for the group might contribute to the close ties formed. Group music can provide 'psycho-physiological gratification' and even help overcome social barriers like caste in India. This effect isn't analogy; it's an **index**, a meaningful association resulting from a natural phenomenon (like Peirce's index).

Finally, let's talk about **Skill**. While Western academic aesthetics might not focus heavily on it, **skill in performing and creating music is highly valued in many societies**, potentially universally. Appreciating others' skill can lead to strong feelings. Historical writings on world music consistently note the appreciation of skillfulness. In the 18th century, 'art' often meant 'skill'. Showing off skill, like dancing while playing or performing complex patterns, is common. Part of the appeal might be the performer taking the risk of failure."

[Slide: Skill Valued, Skill within Structures, Expressing Appreciation]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"Skill is valued by the Tuareg. Players of the _tahardent_ lute perform many variations, expertly using techniques like hemiola to create rhythmic suspension. These skills are key to a performer's reputation.

For those with a **creator orientation**, appreciating skill includes not just the performer's technical ability but also how musical structures are manipulated effectively. Someone familiar with Western forms like fugue or sonata appreciates the composer's skill in creating them. In jazz, listeners appreciate instrument skill _and_ the understanding of underlying structures in improvisation. Skill is often seen as the ability to be **creative within a set of restrictions**. While the emotional reaction to skill might be universal, recognizing the skill itself requires understanding specific musical traditions. Appreciation of skill can be a way of expressing pleasure in the **intrinsic qualities** the skillful musician brings to the performance.

How this appreciation is shown varies culturally. The Kaluli express deep emotion for skillful singing. A good Kaluli singer is said to sound like a bird. Their singing can move hosts to tears, leading to the ritual burning of dancers' backs as an affective response. In Buddhist music, a skilled singer's voice 'shimmers like the sound of stone and metal'. A skilled Shona mbira player might sound like several people playing at once."

[Slide: Conclusion - Legitimacy vs. Aesthetic, Intrinsic Qualities Test]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"In conclusion, there's a close link between music as an **aesthetic form** and its **social legitimacy**. Elite groups often consider music they legitimize to be aesthetic and aesthetically motivated. But distinguishing between music that is **legitimate** and music that is **aesthetic** reveals they aren't necessarily the same. Music legitimized by the elite might lack aesthetic qualities, and music _not_ legitimized might have highly valued **intrinsic qualities**. This means we can look for aesthetic features in music like folk songs, rock, or rap, even if the elite doesn't fully legitimise them. The same applies to non-Western, nonstratified societies that might lack overt aesthetic concepts but use them practically.

Legitimacy is a social phenomenon, while **aesthetic is primarily a quality of the music itself**. Music can be legitimized for many non-aesthetic reasons – influencing spirits, profitability, prestige. So, legitimacy can exist without aesthetic intrinsic qualities. One reason for this disconnect is that rewards might go to those who fit the social scene of the legitimate form, regardless of aesthetic quality. Funding and publication decisions can be made by people with non-musical motivations. High aesthetic achievement might even go unnoticed outside legitimate channels. Think of a talented musical saw player – they might have great aesthetic quality, but won't get the recognition or rewards of someone playing a 'legitimate' instrument.

One test for the value of a music's **intrinsic qualities** is **time**. If music continues to be performed and valued long after it's new, even after its creators are gone, it's a good sign it holds value. The question is whether that value is symbolic, pragmatic, or aesthetic. Often, skilled musicians add complexity to styles over time, and **intrinsic qualities become recognised and valued from within** (like in jazz or rock).

The relationship between legitimate and aesthetic music raises several questions. Does legitimacy or having more time actually lead to _more_ aesthetically satisfying music? Do trained Western listeners value structure or the skill in handling compositional problems? Are modern aesthetic values driven by commercialization or advertising?"

[Slide: Wrapping Up - Universal Aesthetic Features, Function and Meaning]

**(Presenter Notes):**

"We also question if non-Western practitioners truly value the musical details musicologists analyse. While societies have different values, the **fulfillment of those values is key to music's affective power**. The best we can conclude right now is that **sonic design is often a highly valued intrinsic quality, but not everywhere**. The values for different music types are set by each society.

**Aesthetic appreciation** (enjoying intrinsic qualities) is distinct from **emotional impact**. Any type of meaning – symbolic, pragmatic, or aesthetic – can cause emotional responses. So, a performance can be very emotionally moving even if it lacks valued intrinsic qualities.

The study of aesthetics is important for understanding if there are **universal aspects of aesthetics and musical affect**. We don't have full answers, but some possibilities for universal features of musical meaning include:

- Appreciation of **high degrees of skill**.
- The balance of **unity and variety**.
- And **tension and release**, related to Meyer's theory of expectations.

These areas – skill, expectations, and unity/variety balance – are the most likely places to find universal features of musical meaning.

Finally, it's often said that nonstratified societies have 'functional' music, while stratified societies value music 'for its own sake'. Music's pragmatic meaning (its function) is referential. In Western societies, musically trained people value the structural meaning consciously. But Meyer's idea of the emotional impact of structure can apply even to untrained people or societies without formal musical discourse. In other words, the **emotional effect of musical structure** can be a feature of meaning even in cultures where music's value is primarily discussed in terms of its use or function."
