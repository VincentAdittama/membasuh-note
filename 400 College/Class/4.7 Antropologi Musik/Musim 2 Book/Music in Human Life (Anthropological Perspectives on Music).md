# Music in Human Life

## Preface and Acknowledgments

People who study music on a cross-cultural basis have never agreed on the role of anthropology in their field, but they are inclined to agree that it has something important to say. This book is intended to point out why many anthropologists feel that their perspective is important in understanding the place of music in human life. Thus it would be both incorrect and presumptuous to call this book an introduction to ethnomusicology. This book is not intended as an exhaustive presentation of the music of the world, a task which now requires many volumes; it is rather the presentation of a holistic framework for viewing music.

Although the enjoyment of music as performer and listener is more basic than talking or writing about it, the latter activities provide an understanding that should enable people to participate in music with more awareness of what they are doing. This book thus focuses on features of socially determined human motivation and behavior that produce music. It is assumed that musicians are capable of understanding the basic ideas of anthropology, and that anthropologists are capable of understanding the rudiments of music, but that neither group has the time to master the technical professional jargon of the other in its entirety. Viewing the social ramifications of music is intended to provide a broader perspective than musicians customarily achieve when concentrating on performance. Musicians should gain some insight into what music is—not merely in their own society, but as a part of the life of people everywhere. Persons whose interests lie in the social sciences should find here enough detail regarding music as sound that they can develop a clearer understanding of the musical resources used by musicians in various parts of the world. Nonmusical anthropologists will perhaps see that the study of music is not so formidable as the perspective of the highly specialized music profession makes it appear.

This book, in short, is where musicians can turn when they want more information about anthropology, and where anthropologists can turn when they want more information regarding music.

The anthropological approach to music not only provides new perspectives on the subject, it has stimulated the discovery of extensive knowledge about the musical activities of humans all over the world. In 1964 Alan P. Merriam published his Anthropology of Music, urging anthropologists to take music more seriously and seeking to convince musicologists that consideration of the social background of music was essential to fully understanding it. Now, thirty years later, much research has resulted from Merriam’s book, and this new volume includes a survey of the major findings of this research. Moreover, new theoretical approaches have developed since 1964, and they play an important part today in understanding musical behavior.

An important feature of the anthropological perspective is recognizing the importance of attitudes toward music. These attitudes are often the result of social forces of which we are unaware, and they color and perhaps limit our potential to enjoy music. Society is more important in determining attitudes than is the nature of the music itself.

In this day and age when rapid communication has the effect of making the world appear smaller, it is increasingly important to understand people in other societies. Understanding the ways people elsewhere make and use music will, one hopes, lead to a greater appreciation of them as human beings. Comprehending the music of the people of other societies involves not only making sense of the sounds, but also understanding how and why those sounds are formed.

The social forces influencing musical activity operate not only in exotic societies, but also in modern industrial states. An important aim of anthropology in general is to develop new perspectives on one’s own society by increasing sensitivity to how people are living their lives in other societies. Relating this process to music is an important objective of this book.

The study of music, as of any other aspect of culture, involves four major features: form, meaning, use, and function. These four features are related to both musical sounds themselves and to the events at which music occurs. Focusing on these features means that the book is organized in terms of major topics rather than musical or cultural areas. Chapter 1 consists of an introduction to the study of music as the product of human behavior. Chapters 2 and 3 emphasize the role society plays in shaping musical behavior and musical forms. Chapter 2 deals with the forms assumed by the social organization of various societies. Chapter 3 concerns the forms of culturally determined concepts about music and their impact on the music itself. Chapter 4 treats the kinds of musical materials that humans customarily use, including a variety of musical forms and practices commonly found throughout the world. The fifth chapter concerns the question of meaning, or how various features of society and of music cause humans to react to music the way they do. Where Chapters 2–5 focus on the impact of a society and its norms on music, Chapter 6 explores how music serves human needs and influences the course of human events. Chapter 7 concerns the processes of change that occur in human musical activity, both in general terms and in relation to the development of a system of worldwide economic power. Chapter 8 serves as a conclusion to bring together the various ideas and probe their relationship to current forms of musical life.

The examples used throughout the text focus on a few societies from representative areas of the world. These groups are emphasized in order to avoid the confusion that can result from references to too many diverse groups. The book is accompanied by an audiocassette of recorded examples of selected materials. References to this tape are noted in the book as examples, as (Ex. 1.1). Illustrations are referred to as photos, as (Photo 1.1), and musical examples and diagrams are labeled figures, as (Figure 1.1).

Foreign words are italicized except when they are found in English dictionaries as borrowed words. This is the case with such terms as mbira, sitar, and koto, which will nevertheless be explained in the text. Many technical words in social science and music, as well as borrowed words, will be explained in the Glossary at the end of the book. Boldface is used to indicate terms that are likely to be of most importance for the person who goes on to read more detailed works on world music.

Describing this book as an “introduction” implies its use by students. Indeed, it was written with students in mind, but it will be found useful by anyone who is developing an interest in music of the rest of the world. The book does not pretend to exhaustively cover the wealth of information about world music; it does, however, seek to provide an understanding that will make the reading of additional literature more comprehensible and enjoyable. Even without further reading, one should find his or her appreciation of the musics of other societies enhanced.

This book developed through teaching one course in world music and, later, one on anthropology and the arts. I was stimulated to produce it by the lack of a comprehensive undergraduate text covering the anthropological approach to music. This book has been improved considerably by the creative suggestions of many students through the years, particularly those of the fall semesters of 1989 and 1990.

I owe a great deal to all the Shona musicians who helped me become involved in the music of another society, including the tedious recording sessions as well as the welcomes I received at personal, family, and community events. I could not have written this book without the opportunities for field research provided by the University of Zimbabwe, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. I am grateful to DePauw University for allowing time for writing, enabling me to travel in Eastern Europe and Japan, and providing funds for manuscript preparation. I especially appreciate all my colleagues in ethnomusicology whose work I used, and who were so generous in helping me with photographs and recordings. If I misconstrued any of their work it was my shortcoming and not theirs. I finally want to thank my wife, Gloria, and my children, Greta, David, and Marta, for putting up with my many absences from home and my preoccupation with this work as it progressed.

## 1. "Sciencing" about Music

### The Goals of Science

The major goal of science is to explain things, rather than simply to describe or evaluate them. Describing things is basically a preliminary step to later classification and explanation of the data. Description is important because it clarifies the nature of the materials requiring explanation. Just as biologists in the eighteenth century were traveling throughout the world collecting, sketching, and writing descriptions of the exotic animals and plants they found, early musicologists were concerned with recording, notating, and describing the music they heard throughout the world. Because description of music through notation and analysis has been difficult and highly specialized, many scholars of music have not carried their investigations of music much further. The scientific perspective, however, sees the description of a musical style not as an end in itself, but as a means to gain further understanding of musical behavior.

An important task in scientific description of music is defining what it is. Cross-cultural study and comparison of musical practices requires clear definition to be sure that the same types of things are being compared. A problem arises because the definition of music varies widely from one society to another. This variation is shown by the variety of words used to refer to music, as well as by the fact that many languages do not have a word that can be translated as music. Many societies have separate verbs for singing, for playing an instrument, and for dancing, but lack a term that covers only the first two of these, as our word “music” does. Ancient Sanskrit in India, as well as many modern languages in Africa, utilize terms that include all three of the above forms of activity. The Blackfoot people of Montana consider music to be singing, and the things that go with it, including drumming and words, are secondary. The Shona of Zimbabwe and the Venda of South Africa consider drumming and shouting as forms of playing and singing simply because of the presence of rhythm, even though the singing voice is not used. English speakers refer to the sounds of birds and whales as songs, but speakers of many other languages do not relate such sounds to music at all. The Macedonian people in Yugoslavia use the term musika for instrumental sounds, and pesni for singing. Dirges are not considered songs because they elicit sadness rather than pleasure. Most researchers determine for themselves the types of sound that they will include in their study, both using their own definition of music and taking into account the local concepts.

Classification is another step toward explanation. By encouraging discussion in terms of types of things, a system of classification eliminates the cumbersome process of having to deal with each individual case separately. While a classification of materials necessarily follows a certain amount of comparison, it also facilitates further comparison. In biology, the formulation of the Linnaean classifications provided a system for achieving some order among the immense diversity of living organisms that had been found throughout the world. In the study of music, classifications have often been expressed in terms of genre, meaning the types of musical works or performances that occur in any society. Many different criteria distinguish one genre from another, including the way the music is used (lullabies, war songs, ritual songs), features of the performance (solo, chant, chorus), and the instruments used (koto, violin, percussion).

A major problem with determining genres on the basis of these factors is that the classifications vary from one society to another, making a universal classification rather elusive. When the concern of research is the relationship between a society and its music, the focus on the music itself is not particularly enlightening. Even in a single society a particular song can be classified in different ways depending on the situation, particularly as songs change in usage over time. For the Shona people of Zimbabwe, certain songs, known to old people as funeral songs, are viewed by younger people as ancestral spirit songs or even dance songs. John Blacking cites a case of a popular dance song among the Venda of South Africa being called a grinding song simply because someone had heard a woman singing it while grinding grain. In rural India a genre of song called sagun is determined by the context where it is performed rather than by the text or the tune. When focusing on the relationship between society and music, the most effective form of classification is based on the types of music events. These will be presented in the following chapter.

Explanation, as the ultimate goal of “sciencing,” is concerned less with the forms assumed by the object of study than with the processes that lead to those forms. These processes are often termed laws. For example, the genetic principles discovered by Mendel and the more recent research in DNA have provided explanations for the diversity of living creatures found in biology. Social scientists have looked for such laws, but human behavior involves so many complex variables that meaningful laws have evaded formulation. The kind of generalizations about human action that serve as realistic goals of research in human behavior are more accurately termed regularities, i.e., basic principles used for explanation in spite of occasional exceptions. The goals of “sciencing” about music relate to finding regularities in the musical behavior of human beings throughout the world.

“Sciencing” does not include evaluation of music as one of its goals. Musicians customarily include as a part of their work the evaluation of various types of music or various presentations. Whereas the aesthetic approach is concerned with the question of whether certain types of music are good or bad, beautiful or mediocre, the scientific approach is concerned with the question of whether or not music does what its performers intend. This approach also considers how music evokes a response in human beings, and whether such forms of response are universal or determined largely by factors involving particular societies and their norms. Although it is now recognized that truly value-free science is impossible, scientists still strive for as high a degree of objectivity as possible. This objectivity relies on several criteria which form the basis for the methods of science.

### The Methods of Science

In defining science, the methods are as important as the goals. Knowledge of the methods used in science is important not only to the potential researcher, but to everyone. When presented with any set of facts or ideas, one should always ask how that material was obtained. Methods in science include more than simply gathering data. A first step is developing an underlying theoretical framework that clarifies goals and the ways of achieving those goals. When that framework is understood, the techniques of gathering data relevant to a particular research situation are not so difficult to develop.

#### The Holistic Approach

The underlying theoretical framework in anthropology is often called the holistic approach. The term holistic comes from the word “whole,” and it emphasizes two major features of the scientific study of human behavior. First, the holistic approach is inclusive, which means that it does not exclude any known human society throughout the world. Although anthropology has traditionally specialized in small-scale, isolated societies (those commonly called “primitive”), its goal has been to increase our understanding of mankind as a whole by considering all the naturally occurring ways in which humans have organized themselves and wrested a living from the earth. This feature of the holistic approach adds significant dimensions to the study of human musical behavior. Limiting the study of music to the larger, literate societies not only eliminates intriguing types of musical behavior and musical sound, but also deprives researchers of new perspectives from which to view musical activity in their own societies. On the other hand, limiting a study to the small-scale societies customarily emphasized by anthropologists tends to restrict potential implications of the results.

The second feature of the holistic approach is its integrative quality, which results from seeking to understand how different aspects of society or culture are related to each other. This goal is based on the assumption that the relations between things are as important as the nature of the things themselves. In order to achieve a more complete understanding of the whole, the integrative approach links economics, politics, religion, language, and the arts. If the social aspects of music making are omitted and the study of music is limited to the sounds themselves, an illusion is created that music is an entity in itself and musicians need not be concerned with the world around them. Failure to appreciate how other aspects of society and culture influence musical behavior can lead to excessive elitist attitudes in music.

The integrative aspect of the holistic study of music is most apparent in the study of music as part of a sociocultural system. A sociocultural system is often called a society by sociologists and a culture by anthropologists, depending upon the emphasis they are giving to the parts within the system. The term system is used to refer to society and culture because it indicates a collection of phenomena that are so closely related to each other that a change in one of them will bring about changes in others. Social scientists formerly considered societies and cultures to be rather fixed and static. Today it is recognized that social and cultural institutions are constantly being re-created and re-formed to suit people’s needs. These interrelated dynamics are the reason for referring to social and cultural realities as a type of system, although the degree of integration varies according to the time and place, as well as to the aspects of culture that are involved.

Although the sociocultural system is usually a well-integrated unit, it is more clearly analyzed when viewed as consisting of several rather distinct components, as shown in Figure 1.1. The first component is material, consisting of features related to the human requirements for food and shelter, as well as the tools for providing these things. Another component of the sociocultural system is social, and it concerns the need of human beings to relate somehow to the people around them. The social aspect of the sociocultural system includes both social relations and social institutions. Social relations concerns the ways people naturally interact with each other, taking into account conflict, animosities, jealousies, and other personal and individual features that are found in any group of humans. Social institutions are the standardized ways that people relate to each other, such as kinship groups, legal and educational institutions, or special organizations of musicians in guilds or performing groups. The third component of the sociocultural system is the expressive, primarily oriented to the cognitive and emotional needs of humans. The exact nature of these needs is not yet fully understood because it is difficult to distinguish universal human needs from those determined by individual societies. However, these needs are commonly considered to include at least the need to make sense of experience, to express one’s self, and to obtain positive reactions from other people.

Culture, as part of the sociocultural system, is a difficult term to understand because it has several meanings. In the popular humanistic usage, culture is taken to mean a certain degree of erudition, or snobbishness, resulting from appreciation of the various fine arts, certain forms of etiquette, or even particular ways of speaking. In social science, culture has a much wider meaning. To some anthropologists, culture is another way of referring to the entire sociocultural system. To other anthropologists, culture consists basically of ideas or concepts individuals learn from society as part of the process of growing up. These socially learned concepts serve as the basis of human action, including the material (how to build a drum), the social (how to hire musicians), and the expressive (knowing when and how to sing the right song). The concepts serve as a model for action, but not as rules to be blindly followed. Culture, then, involves all of the techniques, values, and symbols that individuals learn from their society and use in adapting to the natural environment, to the social environment, and to their own inner drives.

The combination of these three components of the sociocultural system means that the artifacts created by humans, the patterned social relationships, and the approved types of expressive behavior all work together to generate what we know as the way of life of an ethnic group or socio-economic group. Society can only exist as people relate to each other with some commonly held understandings about communicating and behaving; culture can only exist in the minds of individuals and in the practices by which shared understandings are passed from one generation to the next.

Social scientists discuss society and culture so much that they tend to consider both a form of reality. Actually, social structure and culture are models formulated by the researcher from the regularities observed in behavior. A musical tradition or a musical culture is also a construct formulated in scholars’ minds as they think abstractly. These things find their only true existence in the minds of people within the society. Music itself, however, consists of sound waves, thus it is physically real and not necessarily a mental construct. However, when one hears a very familiar tune in one’s head, that music has then become a mental construct.

The idea of a sociocultural system is important in the study of music because it emphasizes that social dynamics are an integral part of the musical institutions and musical knowledge of peoples throughout the world. The most effective methods of researching the roots of musical behavior seek to relate the personal interactions of musicians and their audiences, the social institutions within which musicians work, and the ideas about music which are held in the society. The musical traditions of a society consist not only of the techniques of performing music, but also the ways of reacting to it, and the evaluation of good, mediocre, and poor performances. The musical system includes the motivation of both musicians and organizers of musical events. Music is not performed in a vacuum, nor can one assume that it is performed merely for amusement. Music has important links with economic arrangements, political action, religion, the other arts, and language. The holistic approach attempts to clarify all of these relationships.

Even though music is often considered only in terms of expressive culture, it has been shown that music is indeed related to the material and social aspects of culture as well. The term musical segment includes the technological, social, and ideational components involved in producing music. Technology and the availability of materials often directly affect the manufacture of musical instruments. For example, the use of metals for musical instruments depends partly on the availability of metal ores and also the knowledge of metal working. The Piaroa Indians of South America, who lack the knowledge of metallurgy, use bark trumpets rather than metal ones. Musical activity is sometimes affected by the environment indirectly, as shown by societies that are nomadic because of scarce resources. Nomadic societies usually have few and rather small instruments. Some groups assemble instruments from materials they have on hand. The Tuareg of the Sahara Desert, for example, make their tende drum by tying a piece of leather over the mortars used in food preparation. Music is closely related to social relations and social institutions because society develops norms that influence the ways people will behave musically. As an expressive feature of culture, music occurs to some extent in all societies, either as play, religion, or entertainment. Although Western society tends to view music as a form of decoration enhancing the activities of life, many societies view it as an essential feature.

Once the researcher has determined basic goals and theoretical perspectives, attention can be given to a specific research situation for planning the process of gathering data. Empirical observation under controlled conditions is the basic scientific means of testing hypotheses. The researcher formulates hypotheses concerning potential regularities and develops specific techniques to assure that data are relevant. In many sciences, controlled conditions require the use of experiments. When the subject of study is human beings, experiments are severely restricted because of limited ways people can be manipulated. Small experiments are occasionally possible; for example, while studying the songs of the Venda people in South Africa, John Blacking sometimes deliberately sang parts of a song wrong to discover the range of variation permitted in Venda society. He reasoned that if his variations were not corrected they were within the range of acceptability to the Venda people.

Many social scientists compensate for restrictions on experiments by studying a variety of societies, since the natural developments through time have provided a sort of natural laboratory. Studying the music of any group of people today often involves going to their country and participating with them in the activities of their lives, including the musical aspects, as Blacking did. This practice is known as participant observation, and serves to take the place of experiments in the study of music of other societies. Participant observation is often called fieldwork, although the latter term can also refer to collecting field recordings without taking part in local activities.

Participant observation is particularly difficult because both the researcher and the objects of study are human beings. Empirical observation depends upon maintaining a high degree of objectivity, which means excluding personal feelings and prejudices from one’s research. Naturally, in working with a specific group of people, the researcher develops strong feelings about them. Both positive feelings, such as gratitude and joy, and negative feelings, such as disgust or sorrow, may become so overwhelming that they threaten the objectivity of the research. These feelings often intensify as people perform music together. Rather than trying to avoid or deny natural human feelings, it is more feasible, as well as more suitable, to incorporate an appraisal of this human factor into an analysis of any situation.

The researcher should not only take care that personal feelings do not distort the research findings, but must also be aware that the social situation is somewhat different because of the presence of an outsider. During several months of research among the Shona in eastern Zimbabwe, I discovered that my study of the mbira was stimulating some members of the local community to become interested in playing it, including several sons of the player with whom I was working. This was not necessarily to be considered bad, but it did require some adjustment of understanding of what might have happened without the outsider’s presence. The outsider can also cause different behavior at musical events when recording them, as shown by the following case in Northern India.

In Indrapur I recorded several women’s pre-wedding song sessions characterized by considerable hilarity, not to say hysteria. It was obvious that the women were excited by having a strange male, especially one with something so magical as a tape recorder, sit with them and ask strange questions in a strange language. Playing back the recordings certainly disturbed the normal flow of events and probably caused some self-consciousness. A friend later confirmed my suspicions, saying the women were distracted and agitated when I recorded them, and did not sing well.

Replication of research, which means the repetition of research with the same results, is often used to ensure empiricism and objectivity. However, when studying human behavior through participant observation, the researcher finds that constantly changing human situations make exact replication impossible. Nevertheless, a high degree of objectivity can be assured, provided one is careful in recording behavior and statements of informants. I was told many times of the traditional Shona belief that one’s skills in playing the mbira developed through help from ancestors appearing in dreams. This verbal evidence was corroborated when people saw me playing and began to engage in heated discussion as to how a white man could be performing on the instrument. Undermining the Shona views of music was avoided when the local musicians assured the listeners that the skill involved in my playing was very limited, and that really great players had the help of the ancestors. In this case the fact that the information gained in a performance situation was compatible with what had been said earlier enhanced the validity and objectivity of the original statements.

Gathering reliable data depends upon noting the difference between the scientific perspective deliberately chosen by the outside observer and the characteristic commonsense perspective of the participant in the society under study. In anthropology these two perspectives have often been labeled the etic view and the emic view, respectively, using terms derived from linguistics. Because the etic view represents the outsider, it has often been considered more objective. This view has often led researchers to focus on the material aspects of a society because of the emphasis given to objectivity in science. The emic view has often been thought to be more subjective, and has consequently been given a smaller role in research, although this practice has been challenged. The distinction between the two perspectives is necessary and important, but it is equally important to make sure that the two are not oversimplified. The etic approach in a given research situation must include consideration of the participants’ actual behavior as well as the objectively verifiable material constraints influencing the participants. The emic approach, seen as the people’s commonsense explanation of their behavior, also constitutes significant data. What the participants think they are doing or intend to do may be as illuminating as what they are doing. The importance of studying the ideals for behavior as well as the behavior itself is a major reason for studying living groups rather than recorded sound.

Two different aspects of the commonsense perspective have frequently been overlooked because of failure to note the distinction between practical consciousness and discursive consciousness. Practical consciousness is the individual’s knowledge of how to deal with particular situations, even though such knowledge is seldom or ever put into words. Most of our practical consciousness is derived from growing up in a particular society and shaping our behavior to that of the people around us. It is basically the commonsense perspective, and is seldom questioned. Practical consciousness is apparent when a musician can perform on his instrument but is unable to explain it to anyone else. This aspect of cultural knowledge has often been called implicit, covert, or tacit culture. Discursive consciousness is that aspect of knowledge which a person is able to verbalize or explain. It, too, is derived largely from one’s experiences in society, and is often called explicit, overt, or manifest culture. Discursive consciousness includes the culturally acceptable rationalizations about goals and motivations that are involved in human action, including music making. This form of discourse is characteristic of the aesthetic or philosophical perspective. Both of these types of consciousness are operative and very important in understanding musical behavior. They are both distinct from the unconscious, which involves the universal human needs mentioned earlier as the basis for expressive culture. These unconscious aspects of life seldom appear as discourse, but may be important motivations for musical behavior. In the Western world, musical discourse has taken the form of music theory and philosophy of music. Discourse in many societies throughout the world is severely limited, although many musicians will be producing and enjoying extremely sophisticated music on the basis of practical consciousness. However, since producing music has to be grounded in activity of the human mental system, some sort of mental structuring of the sounds or the movements necessary to produce them can be assumed to be present. One problem often facing researchers is that information given by informants is often confusing and even contradictory. This may sometimes be due to the informant’s reluctance to reveal a society’s unique knowledge; it may also be due to the fact that discourse in music is not commonly practiced in that society, so that no individual has ever thought through or verbalized the practical knowledge that is taken for granted. Because the value of discourse is sometimes not understood, the informant or musician might improvise a statement simply to please the researcher.

As Western music, with its complex system of discursive theory, has spread throughout the world, it has become increasingly prestigious to develop theories about musical features that were previously limited to the practical consciousness. Different musical systems seem to have features that lend themselves to discursive treatment and other features which do not. In Java, for example, musicians noted the complex Western theory of tuning, and tried to adapt it, encountering negative and frustrating results. Javanese music, however, has a formal system of complex cycles, (gongan, to be explained in Chapter 4) that lend themselves to discursive or theoretical treatment much more easily than do the formal aspects of Western music.

The important point here is that musical systems are made by humans, and they usually contain very complex phenomena produced without full awareness of the complexity. In this respect musical systems resemble languages.

Formulating a theoretical background and gathering reliable data are incomplete without analysis. Both the music itself and the social action related to it should be analyzed. The question has often been raised about whether an outsider with an analytical perspective can ever understand what the participant in another society is thinking and doing, particularly in such a subjective field as music. Certainly the outsider will never understand music or anything else in the same way or to the same extent as a participant. On the other hand, the participants, unless trained in research techniques, are unlikely to be aware of many factors related to the practical consciousness. The researcher complements the participant’s knowledge with the power of analysis. While involved in the practical activities of life, the participant is often unaware of the wider implications or consequences of what is happening. The observer, concerned with discourse rather than practice, will develop a larger perspective through undertaking an analysis of the situation. Analysis often includes inferences derived from concrete situations of behavior and speech as the participant unknowingly reveals his practical consciousness. When learning to play the mbira in Zimbabwe, I was very much afraid of hitting the wrong note—a result of early piano lessons. One day the mbira expert who was helping me gave me a stern lecture. It was perfectly all right to hit the wrong note, any note would do, but never slow down, and never stop! This emphatic statement revealed the practical consciousness basic to the creation of Shona music as contrasted with that needed for Western music. Analysis by the observer must include not only the material conditions involved in musical activity, but also the nature of the practical consciousness of the participants in the society. The music sound itself is a creation of the practical consciousness, and recording and analyzing it provides an important key to the mental processes of the musician. The observer’s perspective must also include an understanding of the discursive consciousness of the participants, achieved by listening carefully to what they say. Even though the observer will never fully understand many features of the life of the participant, analysis can provide a view of events that places the participants’ lives and musical behavior in a clearer perspective. Social analysis is enhanced by recognition of the different levels from which human activity may be viewed. On the most basic level, analysis can be limited to a certain piece of music or a specific performance. At a somewhat higher level, analysis can focus on the work of individual musicians. The next level consists of the music events themselves, where scholars often concentrate their activity because the event highlights the relationship between society and music. The community is a higher level at which musical behavior may be analyzed, such as, for example, the activity involved when a community decides to present its traditional music to tourists. A higher level of analysis is that of the ethnic group, often called a tribe or nation. This social unit often serves as the focus of research in social science. Presumably, the highest level of musical activity is the global level, which becomes most apparent in the modern rock music sweeping over the world.

#### Performance

As noted earlier, scientific objectivity rejects the tendency to evaluate. Where language is concerned, it is commonplace to distinguish between common ordinary speech on the one hand and formal language, oratory, or literature on the other. The first of these is considered a form of casual activity, whereas the others are considered to be more creative. When studying musical behavior, however, it is not common to distinguish between casual and creative renditions of music. The common distinction is between good and bad renditions. In approaching music from the scientific perspective, however, judgment of the effectiveness of any type of music will necessarily be related to its intended purposes. The scientific observer should give the same degree of serious consideration to casual renditions as to music presented as creative activity. By focusing on a distinction between casual and creative music activity rather than good or bad music, the analyst acquires a means of distinguishing different styles and genres of music without becoming evaluative.

The folklorist Richard Bauman has provided an objective framework for studying different types of language behavior by focusing on the concept of performance. Performance in this sense occurs when the individual anticipates that a presentation, whether it be recounting a tale, singing, or playing, will be evaluated by an audience. Language in the performance context is considered creative behavior; outside the performance it is simply casual. The same distinction between casual rendition and creative performance operates in musical situations, and the difference between the two contexts is clearly indicated by several cues, which vary from one society to another. The term marking has been used to indicate the use of such cues in a musical situation to make this distinction. In the Western world the concert setting often serves as a marker, including special dress or costumes, the dimming lights, the applause and bow, and often the movements of the musician that have nothing to do with producing the sound. The lack of such markers is commonly regarded as absence of intention to be evaluated, so that a rehearsal or singing in the shower are not considered a performance.

The concept of performance as a key to understanding creative activity is very relevant to music, and in any society the analyst must learn to observe the cues which mark the performance mode. Looking for markers in the cross-cultural situation will enable the researcher to gain a more accurate idea of what is occurring in the minds of the persons engaged in the activity. For example, the Kpelle of Liberia have a clear idea of the difference between a performance and behavior occurring outside the performance context. They habitually encircle the area of a performance to separate the performance area from ordinary space, so that evil spirits might be kept away from the performance. This practice also serves to alert everyone in the community that a performance is about to occur. Among the Inuit, also known as Eskimo, the first stanza of a drum dance song was devoted to a modest declaration of the singer’s lack of ability, a clear indication that an evaluative response was expected.

Sometimes a community knows that the performance mode is intended because it customarily accompanies certain types of activity. Among Hungarian peasants the very act of singing dirges or mourning songs was considered a performance to be done by women. People watch the performance very carefully and discuss it afterwards: “She wailed beautifully,” “She hasn’t even mourned for him,” etc. They criticize the mourner if her sincerity is open to doubt, or if she has not come up to expectations.

A final point concerning scientific method in research is that it is viewed in two different ways. One view maintains that scientists should restrict their efforts to those problems that are amenable to a suitably rigorous method. If a question poses severe methodological difficulties, it should be ignored in favor of questions where the methodological problems can be more satisfactorily solved. The other view maintains that some questions are very important, and they should be approached scientifically even though the problems of method are difficult. Rigorous use of what methods are available and relentless search for better methods constitute a form of challenge. The first of these approaches is more common in the natural sciences; the second is more common among social sciences, primarily because the study of human behavior is subject to so many variables that a flawless methodology is virtually impossible. Social scientists often proceed in spite of methodological difficulties because certain questions are so important that it is preferable to research with imperfect methods than not to research at all. Research into musical behavior as a social science is often not amenable to rigorous method; it is, however, an important topic in understanding what humans are doing as they create musical sounds to express themselves and enhance their lives in communities.

#### Research Ethics

Ethics is a scientific issue that should be considered especially carefully when doing research involving human beings. During the period when most of the non-Western world was ruled by European powers, the superiority of European culture was often assumed and its power was not to be challenged. Researchers in the past have been accused of supporting colonial power and exploiting people of the non-Western world. Today most researchers recognize the nature of exploitation. They are careful in handling information that may have political overtones, and they do not publish or even talk about matters considered secret by the people being studied. In the past, researchers and collectors have carried off musical instruments; even though the instruments were paid for, they may have been irreplaceable, thus depriving people of their music. Carelessness or exploitation in relation to recordings of ethnic music has frequently occurred, although today researchers as well as traditional musicians have become aware of the need to share any benefits accruing from the sale of recordings. Even in writing up research materials, full recognition is now given to the facts and insights provided by the local people. Undermining or changing other people’s beliefs, as nearly occurred with my mbira playing, can often be harmful because it can weaken the world view on which people base their lives.

### Theories of Society and Music

Studying music in the framework of social science raises the questions of how much the sociocultural system affects music and conversely, to what extent music can affect the sociocultural system. These questions have been approached in several different ways. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars were less concerned with explaining human behavior in specific sociocultural systems than they were with discovering why these systems differed from each other. Early explanations for the differences took the form of a postulated universal historical progression from savagery through various stages of barbarism to civilization. The less technologically advanced societies were placed somewhere on the continuum as a means of explaining why they were “backward,” i.e., different from Western societies. In the early twentieth century it became apparent that these schemes of cultural progression were based primarily on conjecture, and scholars sought new ways of explaining why the many societies scattered throughout the globe were so diverse. The theories developed for this purpose affected scholars’ ideas of music’s relationship to society. The major approaches were neo-evolutionism, functionalism, and various interactionist and generative theories.

#### The Neo-evolutionary View

The neo-evolutionist approach explained differences between sociocultural systems on the basis of adaptation to the natural environment. Followers of this approach recognized the three parts of a sociocultural system mentioned earlier, but they emphasized a hierarchical arrangement. The material or technological level was considered basic and determinative of the nature of a whole sociocultural system. The second level, the social, was seen to be subject to the types of subsistence activities required by environmental conditions. The third level was termed ideological rather than expressive, and it was viewed as the common beliefs necessary to maintain order and generally adaptive behavior in a society. These three levels of society have been compared to the layers of a cake.

The neo-evolutionary view has certain merits, but it has often resulted in unrealistic approaches to music or failure to consider it at all. Since music is not seen as directly related to the processes of producing goods, because it is frequently expressive, and because it cannot be visually measured, it has been assigned to the ideological subsystem. Since the technological level is considered to be determinative of the other two, music came to be widely considered a by-product or decoration of the major forces of social life—a frosting on the cake, so to speak. Because of this view, neo-evolutionary theory has contributed little to an understanding of music.

Research of musical behavior itself, however, shows that music is related to all three of the sociocultural components, as indicated earlier. Rather than resembling the frosting on a cake, musical life is more like a slice of the cake, the musical segment. Although it is often accurate to say that music serves an ideological purpose, it is misleading to say that it is to be understood solely as a part of the ideological component. Music, as one aspect of a sociocultural system, is the product of technological, social, and ideological forces, and is not solely the by-product of any one of them.

The relationship between society and music was explored from the neo-evolutionary perspective by Alan Lomax. He used cross-cultural statistical techniques to compare singing styles from 233 different societies and relate them to subsistence systems. Recordings of ten songs from each group were rated by groups of college students according to thirty-seven variables, including the nature of singing groups, relation of instruments to group, melodic form, embellishments, volume, and raspiness. These features were correlated with information about the cultures that is contained in ethnographic accounts at the Human Relations Area Files at Yale University. Through this method Lomax found that song styles shift consistently with productive range, political level, level of stratification of class, severity of sexual mores, balance of dominance between male and female, and level of social cohesiveness.

Many scholars of music realize that Lomax is doing something important, and that his work is both sophisticated and provocative. At the same time it is seen to be highly oversimplified.

One problem is whether his work is based on sufficiently large samples. For example, his portrayal of the music of village India as part of an “Old High Culture,” indicates that it is characterized by an “exclusive and elaborated dominance” where a solo performer, accompanied by an orchestra, sings a precisely enunciated, long, and complex text. Detailed research in village India, however, has revealed many types of musical styles not conforming to this characterization. A significant difference in styles is found, depending on whether the music is performed by specialists or by non-specialists. Many communal music groups actively perform devotional music, festival songs, and play songs in which the elaborated style is not found at all. Even when specialists perform, the characteristics described by Lomax do not dominate in their styles. Lomax has assumed that song styles are homogeneous, which does not seem to be the case. How could such a diverse situation as village India be characterized by ten songs?

Another problem is the question of accurate rating of the styles. Many of the criteria are not well defined. Rating-scale items such as nasalization, raspiness, and enunciation could be factors involving a particular performer. Length of text and wordiness could vary from day to day with the same performer in traditions where verbal improvisation is important. American college students were trained to provide consistent ratings, but the consistency could have been provided by perceptions based on their own common cultural background.

Lomax’s theoretical orientation is neo-evolutionary, since he seeks for causal connections between the economic and political systems of a society and the modes of expression. Only time and further study will confirm or deny the validity of Lomax’s work. The question of the relations between the sociocultural system and music has continued to interest many scholars of worldwide music, and it will probably be seen that the question requires much more detailed investigation than Lomax was able to undertake.

#### Functionalism

Another reaction to nineteenth-century evolutionary theories was functionalism. It explained all sociocultural phenomena according to the contribution each feature of a society made to the group’s continued well-being. An analogy was drawn between the social system and a living organism, in which all the parts make their contribution to the health of the entire system. A. R. Radclitfe-Brown was a major figure in formulating functionalism, and his description of dance among the Andaman Islanders of the Indian Ocean provides a good example of how function was used to explain the continued existence of music and dance in a society:

> Finally, in order to understand the function of the Andamanese dance it must be noted that every adult member of the community takes some part in it. All the able-bodied men join in the dance itself; all the women join in the chorus. If anyone through ill-health or old age is unable to take any active part, he or she is at least necessarily a spectator, for the dance takes place in the centre of the village in the open space toward which the huts usually face.
>
> The Andamanese dance (with its accompanying song) may therefore be described as an activity in which, by virtue of the effects of rhythm and melody, all the members of a community are able harmoniously to cooperate and act in unity; which requires on the part of the dancer a continual condition of tension free from strain; and which produces in those taking part in it a high degree of pleasure. ...
>
> In this way the dance produces a condition in which the unity, harmony and concord of the community are at a maximum, and in which they are intensely felt by every member. It is to produce this condition, I would maintain, that is the primary social function of the dance. The well-being, or indeed the existence, of the society depends on the unity and harmony that obtain in it, and the dance, by making that unity intensely felt, is a means of maintaining it. For the dance affords an opportunity for the direct action of the community upon the individual, and we have seen that it exercises in the individual those sentiments by which the social harmony is maintained.

As research continued among diverse societies around the world, it became apparent that functionalism as a theoretical approach had its limitations. In assuming a positive function for social practices, it did not allow for behavior that might have a negative effect on the life of a group, nor did it consider the possibility that some behavior might have neither positive nor negative effects. Another weakness of the approach was its assumption that a society had a stable way of life that indefinitely provided its members with satisfactory conditions for their lives. Functionalism was thus not equipped to consider the change inherent in human society.

#### Interactionist Views

Several approaches in the latter half of the century are variously called generative or symbolic interactionist, and more recently practice theory. These perspectives focus on interaction among individuals and groups, and how this interaction generates the forms of social and expressive realities. As individuals seek to solve the problems and reach the goals in their own lives, they are constantly making decisions. They use the values and techniques which they learn from the people around them as a guide to behavior, but they do not slavishly follow it. People often flout the norms when it seems expedient to do so. The resulting pattern of decisions made by many individuals results in the modification of culture. These patterns provide the basis for scientific generalization. This approach to understanding society and culture serves much better than the neo-evolutionary or functional approaches as a basis for studying the relationships between society and music. Thus, both societies and music traditions are to be seen not as static entities but as common modes of action reproduced with varying degrees of continuity. This approach makes it possible to consider both the effect of society upon musical practices and the effects of music on the society.

One of the reasons for the importance of the levels of analysis mentioned earlier is that they clarify certain differences in perspective. The neo-evolutionist view is based on very high, global levels of analysis. The generative perspective is on the personal and group levels of analysis. At high levels of analysis the role of music is rather difficult to discern. At the lower levels of analysis it is more easily seen, and sometimes music is quite pervasive.

Alan P. Merriam, a pioneer in the anthropological study of music, presented a model of musical behavior that complements the interactionist and generative approaches. He saw musical sound as a product or artifact of the behavior that produces it. This behavior is generated by concepts about music formed in the individual mind by interaction with other people in society. The sounds of music produced by musical behavior provide feedback to the performer and listener, either modifying or reinforcing the concepts. Not all behavior related to music actually produces sound, such as the act of copying a musical manuscript or purchasing a recorded tape. Nevertheless, such behavior does influence the concepts about music. Moreover, nonmusical behavior is often important in generating musical events. Figure 1.2 modifies Merriam’s model to indicate that both musical behavior and musical sound help determine the concepts.

### Ethnomusicology and Music

The holistic study of music is a part of the scholarly discipline of ethnomusicology, although not all ethnomusicologists utilize that perspective. Formerly known as comparative musicology, ethnomusicology first appeared as the result of the interest of musicians in the music of non-Western peoples. Since ancient times, some people have found exotic music to be an interesting subject for observation, but such interest was usually limited to the sounds themselves. During the nineteenth century the origins of human cultural practices provided a central goal of research, for it was commonly believed that people with simple technologies must have other cultural features similar to those of our prehistoric ancestors. The general interest in origins spread to music, so that early studies of the music of tribal peoples focused on origins of music in relation to other schemes of origin. It has since been found that musical practices change considerably over time, and we have no way of knowing whether or not any of the music found and recorded in the past hundred years bears any resemblance at all to the music presumably created by prehistoric humans.

The prevailing mode of thought in the nineteenth century considered the music of small-scale non-literate societies to be “primitive.” This idea was based on the erroneous notion that people who created it were somehow only beginning to understand the world around them, and they were making nothing but noise as they sang and danced. The term “primitive” has derogatory connotations and should be avoided, since we now know that all musical systems have some very complex and sophisticated qualities. The term “primitive” is often simply used to indicate something we cannot relate to, and it becomes an admission of defeat when one is undertaking a comparative study of music.

Nineteenth-century attitudes gradually dissipated as research in non-Western musical systems grew. Until the invention of recording devices in 1877, preserving musical sounds for study was both difficult and inaccurate. Even today, persons trained in notating European music find great difficulty in writing down non-Western musics, partly because their scales and rhythms are often not related to the European system of notation. Moreover, musicians in many societies are unaccustomed to breaking their music into small segments, nor do they customarily repeat performances several times the same way. After Edison’s recording cylinders appeared, researchers were soon seeking to record as wide an assortment of non-Western music as possible. Fears were expressed that rapid westernization would soon cause the disappearance of indigenous forms of music. Ethnomusicological research at first consisted of putting such recordings in archives, and subsequently notating and analyzing the music. Many researchers, particularly Americans working with acculturated Indian groups, began to see the need for going out among the people in other societies and studying firsthand not only the music sound, but also how people conceptualized and valued the music they used. The participant observation methods of anthropology thus came to be associated with musicology. Today compact tape recorders and extensive scholarship have made possible the comparative study of a wide range of human societies and the musical cultures associated with them.

Ethnomusicologists today have reached no clear consensus about their goals and methods. The idea that ethnomusicology is a form of discourse consisting of a scientific or scholarly approach to music is widely accepted. Some people calling themselves ethnomusicologists are essentially engaged in cross-cultural musical practice that might more aptly be called ethnomusicianship. When dealing with societies having extensive historical records and some form of music notation, the methods of ethnomusicology have tended to be more historical. Societies having no form of notation or any writing at all are usually researched through the methods of participant observation. In some ways, ethnomusicologists have tried to include in one discipline the diversity of materials that in other areas of study are considered separate. Whereas the study of language divides into sociolinguistics, structural linguistics, and comparative literature, ethnomusicology does not have separate terminology to distinguish between those who focus on social factors of music making, on musical structures, or on qualities of appreciation. The practice of ethnomusicology is proceeding well; it is the discourse which still causes problems.

The goals of holistic “sciencing” about music can be summarized as seeking explanations of human musical behavior. One might well ask, however, why such explanations are of any importance. The inclusive and integrative study of music provides us with new and different views of what music is all about. Other societies view music differently than we do; it is possible that we have something to learn from them. Studying music in relation to the processes of other sociocultural systems helps us see how our own musical practices are influenced by sociocultural factors that we have often failed to recognize. We should be led to consider such questions as to whether our society has a positive or negative influence on our musical life. To what extent is our musical life governed by commercial interests? Are our ideas about aesthetic values in music simply an historical accident, or do they actually describe an important feature of human musical activity? These and other questions provide some of the reasons for looking carefully at music in societies throughout the world.

## 2. The Sociocultural Matrix: Social Factors

### Types of Societies

In the nineteenth century, European societies were entranced with the idea of progress. The industrial revolution had begun to produce goods that raised standards of living to unprecedented heights. The progress that had taken place in European technology was assumed to characterize all of human life, including the expressive aspects of culture. Progress, in turn, was used to explain the differences in lifestyles of people throughout the world, including their musical practices. With a few exceptions, Europeans found non-European music bewildering and even distasteful, and they assumed that the cause was insufficient progress in musical knowledge.

As anthropologists went throughout the world in the early twentieth century, they discovered that people in non-Western societies, both literate and nonliterate, had quite sophisticated sociocultural systems even though their technology was often less complex than that of Europe. In every society, anthropologists found highly intelligent, articulate people who reflected seriously about the world in terms of the background provided by their societies. These discoveries led to the conclusion that the innate mental processes of all human beings are basically the same, and that other people’s ways of doing things did not necessarily indicate a lack of progress. Thus, one of the major insights of anthropology developed: that one’s society and culture are of major importance in determining what a person does. This was also found to be true of the behaviors characterizing whole groups of people, including their music. The fact that some societies in the world had relatively uncomplicated forms of music was no longer considered to lie in some fault or ignorance of the individuals concerned, but rather in the ways people in various societies learned to perform and appreciate music. Consequently, the explanation of widely diverse musical traditions has come to be attributed to differences in historical background and the dynamics of life in societies.

Using the term sociocultural matrix to refer to the social background of music emphasizes that the society and the culture have an impact on the nature of the music. Matrix has been defined as “something within which something else originates or develops,” a situation that applies to the relationship between a sociocultural system and its music. Many ethnomusicologists have pointed to the importance of the “social context” or “cultural context” of music. The term “context” does not preclude the tendency to think of music as somehow developing from within itself and simply being shaped by external circumstances, much as a tree develops from its genetic makeup but is influenced by the presence of surrounding buildings and other trees. References to the context of music frequently have the connotation of program notes—the explanations provided in the printed program at a concert or recital. Such explanations are intended to enhance the audience’s appreciation of the music by presenting an idea of the romantic involvements or political difficulties of the composer. The context can be useful in determining the meaning of particular presentations of music, but thinking in terms of the matrix from which music develops is more useful in explaining why musical occasions and performances may take one form rather than another.

From the perspective of social science, music is seen exclusively as a feature of human behavior. Even the view that the calls of birds and whales are “songs” is an act of the human mind not likely shared by the animals involved. Since music is the result of human activity, and because humans behave in accordance with the cultural norms they have learned, it follows that music itself results from the sociocultural situation within which it is produced. A significant step in understanding the nature of musical behavior, then, is to clarify the different types of sociocultural situations in which people live and produce music.

As noted in Chapter 1, classifying information is one of the intermediate goals of scientific study. Anthropologists have classified societies according to their gradual increase in size and complexity, although the differences between these societies are often not as distinct as the various categories make them appear. Since all societies in the world today have been incorporated into the world economic and political system to varying degrees, these classifications are often blurred. They are important, however, as they still describe the original types of social matrices that gave rise to the musical systems operating at the time Europeans began to study many of these societies.

As formulated by Morton H. Fried, a basic distinction in classifying societies is the difference between stratified and nonstratified societies. Although stratified societies have existed for several millennia, they were preceded everywhere by nonstratified societies, many of which still existed as Europeans expanded their knowledge of the world from the fifteenth century onward. Nonstratified societies are basically those in which access to natural resources is not restricted by any individual or group. The forms of subsistence production characterizing such groups are either hunting and gathering (foraging) or horticulture (shifting agriculture). Because these production techniques seldom produce a surplus, no one can gain the power to dominate such societies by gaining control of excess production. Other nonstratified societies are found among pastoralists, who live off their herds of livestock. Although pastoral groups often produce a surplus, it does not create social divisions because constantly moving about for pastures assures social flexibility. Nonstratified societies are considered to be of two types, egalitarian and rank. Egalitarian societies seldom practice equality between men and women, but within their particular gender roles all individuals have equal opportunity to fulfill any social role for which their personal abilities qualify them. According to archaeologists, all humans at one time lived by hunting and gathering, and they all lived in egalitarian societies. Although some egalitarian societies are still found in the world today, they are becoming increasingly rare.

An example of an egalitarian society is provided by the Mbuti Pygmies in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Zaire in Central Africa. They are primarily hunters and gatherers whose rain forest environment provides them everything they need for what they consider a comfortable existence. The women gather mushrooms, nuts, and berries, while the men hunt with bows and poison arrows. The favorite food of the Mbuti is honey, which they collect in season. They consider the forest to have a spirit, and their songs and dances are designed to keep the forest spirit happy. Song is thought to be the activity which most pleases the forest because it is considered cool, as is the shady forest. Song is pleasing because it requires breath, the “life force,” as well as effort.

Other egalitarian hunting and gathering societies with interesting musical practices are the Aborigines of Australia and the Inuit of North America, more commonly known as Eskimo. The Aborigines are the original inhabitants of the continent of Australia who were largely displaced by English settlers arriving there in the nineteenth century. The Aborigines developed their civilization for more than forty thousand years with little or no contact with the outside world. Most of the Aboriginal groups living in the developed areas of Australia were wiped out or assimilated into Australian culture. The Aboriginal groups that have been able to continue their traditional ways of life down to the present time live mostly in the central desert or the tropical area of Arnhem Land. Each of the various bands or tribes had its own geographical area where it had the right to hunt and gather. A complex form of social organization based on clans symbolized by totems maintained the system. Their religious beliefs are based on a mythical time in the past, called the Dreamtime, that is considered to be the explanation and cause of everything that exists in the present. Their complex rituals reenact the events of the Dreamtime, through symbolic images, mimetic dances, and complex series of song cycles.

The inhabitants of the North American Arctic region have commonly been called Eskimo, but their own term, Inuit, has been adopted for referring to them because the term Eskimo has come to be considered pejorative. Traditionally the Inuit, from Greenland through Canada and Alaska to Siberia, lived entirely by hunting and fishing. Some of the more southerly groups hunted caribou in the summers, but the Inuit depended heavily upon marine mammals such as seals, walruses, and whales. They utilized the hides of these animals to make their major musical instrument, the frame drum. Their music was used for communicating with the supernatural and for relieving tension in the community. Today they are becoming increasingly involved with the economies of Canada and the United States.

Rank societies are similar to egalitarian societies in that they do not have restrictions on access to natural resources. They are different, however, in that some social roles are restricted to certain groups or individuals. These restrictions are usually in the form of specific lineages or clans from which leaders are chosen. Rank societies are often considered to be transitional between nonstratified and stratified forms of society. Rank societies often have songs honoring the chief or other leader, but lack the elaborate elite music establishments characterizing truly stratified societies. The transitional nature of rank societies is seen on the small Polynesian island of Tikopia, located in the South Pacific between Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Its chiefs have an honored position in the society, and often have more land than commoners, but they do not have the power to deprive the commoners of goods they need for their livelihood.

Examples of rank societies include the Shona of Zimbabwe prior to the European invasion of their lands in the 1890s. Living by horsekeeping and agriculture, the Shona had a system of chiefs and headmen, but these leaders did not have the power to deprive others of land or resources. Their music included praise songs for chiefs, but the society did not have a class of professional musicians.

Stratified societies, in contrast, are those in which access to resources is restricted and social roles are determined by birth or class. These societies are characterized by the presence of social classes or castes, and often have a ruling elite. Stratified societies developed with the rise of agriculture and the accumulation of surplus resources, which allowed some individuals or groups to control land and wealth. This led to the development of complex political systems, cities, and states. In such societies, music often reflects social divisions, with different genres or styles associated with different classes or castes. Professional musicians may form guilds or be attached to the courts of rulers, and music may be used to reinforce social hierarchies.

### Music Events and Music Complexes

Music does not exist in a vacuum; it is always part of a larger event or complex of activities. A music event is a social occasion in which music plays a central role, such as a ritual, festival, dance, or concert. These events are shaped by the cultural norms and values of the society, and they provide the context in which music is created, performed, and experienced. Music complexes are sets of related music events and practices that form a coherent system within a society. For example, the cycle of rituals and festivals in a traditional society may constitute a music complex, with each event having its own musical forms and meanings.

The study of music events and complexes helps us understand how music functions in society and how it is integrated with other aspects of life. It also reveals the ways in which music is used to mark important occasions, express group identity, and reinforce social relationships. By examining the structure and organization of music events, we can gain insight into the values and priorities of the society as a whole.

### Social Roles in Musical Activities

Music events in any society involve a variety of participants who take on different social roles. These roles are shaped by the society’s structure, values, and traditions. In some societies, everyone participates in music making, while in others, musical performance is reserved for specialists or certain social groups. The distinction between professional and amateur musicians, or between ritual specialists and lay participants, reflects broader patterns of social organization.

Musical roles can include composers, performers, instrument makers, teachers, and organizers of events. In many societies, the role of the musician is closely linked to other social roles, such as religious leaders, healers, or community leaders. The status of musicians varies widely: in some cultures, musicians are highly respected, while in others, they may be marginalized or even stigmatized.

The transmission of musical knowledge and skills is also an important aspect of social roles. In some societies, musical training is formalized through apprenticeships or schools, while in others, it is learned informally through participation and observation. Gender, age, and social class can all influence who is allowed or expected to participate in musical activities and in what capacity.

Understanding the social roles in musical activities helps us see how music is embedded in the fabric of society and how it both reflects and shapes social relationships.

### Conclusion

The study of the sociocultural matrix of music reveals that musical behavior is deeply embedded in the social structures, roles, and events of every society. By examining the types of societies, the organization of music events, and the social roles involved in musical activities, we gain a clearer understanding of how music both shapes and is shaped by the broader patterns of human life. This perspective highlights the importance of considering music not as an isolated art form, but as a vital and integrated aspect of social existence.

## 3. The Sociocultural Matrix: Conceptual Factors

### Concepts of What Music Is

Every society has its own ideas about what constitutes music. These concepts are shaped by cultural beliefs, language, and social experience. In some societies, the word “music” may not even exist, and the activities that English speakers would call music may be divided into separate categories such as singing, playing instruments, or dancing. For example, in some African and Asian languages, there are distinct terms for singing and for playing instruments, but no single term that encompasses both. In other cultures, music may be closely linked with dance or ritual, and not considered a separate activity at all.

The definition of music is therefore not universal, but culturally constructed. What one society considers music, another may not. For instance, the Blackfoot people of Montana consider music to be singing, with drumming and words as secondary. The Shona of Zimbabwe and the Venda of South Africa include drumming and shouting as forms of playing and singing because of the presence of rhythm, even if the singing voice is not used. English speakers may refer to the sounds of birds and whales as songs, but many other cultures do not relate such sounds to music.

These differences in conceptualization affect not only what is performed and valued as music, but also how music is taught, learned, and transmitted. Understanding the local concepts of what music is provides important insight into the role of music in society and the ways in which people experience and interpret musical sound.

### Social Legitimization of Music

In every society, music is not only defined by what it is, but also by who is allowed or encouraged to make it, and under what circumstances. Social legitimization refers to the ways in which societies grant approval, authority, or value to certain musical practices, genres, or participants. This legitimization can be formal, such as through religious or governmental endorsement, or informal, through community acceptance and tradition.

In some cultures, music is closely tied to religious or ceremonial life, and only certain individuals—such as priests, shamans, or ritual specialists—are permitted to perform it. In other societies, music may be a communal activity, with broad participation encouraged. The legitimacy of music can also be influenced by social class, gender, age, or ethnicity, with some groups having privileged access to musical roles while others are excluded or marginalized.

The process of legitimization shapes not only who makes music, but also what kinds of music are valued, preserved, or transmitted. For example, court music in many societies is often seen as more prestigious than folk or popular music, and may receive official support. Conversely, some musical forms may be suppressed or discouraged if they are associated with dissent, minority groups, or behaviors considered inappropriate by those in power.

Understanding social legitimization helps explain why certain musical traditions flourish while others fade, and how music can serve as a marker of identity, status, or resistance within a society.

### Music as an Aspect of Expressive Culture

Music is a fundamental part of what anthropologists call expressive culture—the domain of human activity that includes the arts, religion, language, and other forms of symbolic expression. Expressive culture serves to communicate ideas, emotions, and values, often in ways that transcend ordinary language or practical action. Music, as a form of expressive culture, is used to convey meaning, create social bonds, and articulate individual and group identities.

In many societies, music is closely linked with other expressive forms such as dance, poetry, and visual arts. Rituals, ceremonies, and festivals often combine music with movement, costume, and symbolic objects to create powerful experiences that reinforce cultural values and social cohesion. The expressive power of music lies in its ability to evoke emotion, mark transitions, and provide a sense of continuity with the past.

The study of music as expressive culture highlights the ways in which musical practices are embedded in broader systems of meaning. It also draws attention to the creativity and agency of individuals and groups in shaping musical traditions, adapting them to new circumstances, and using them to express both shared and personal experiences.

### Socialization in Music

Socialization in music refers to the processes by which individuals learn the musical practices, values, and meanings of their society. This learning begins in early childhood and continues throughout life, as people are exposed to the sounds, performances, and social uses of music in their community. Socialization occurs both formally, through instruction and participation in organized musical activities, and informally, through everyday experiences such as family gatherings, religious ceremonies, and media exposure.

In many societies, children learn music by imitation and participation, gradually acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to perform and appreciate the music of their culture. The methods and expectations for musical learning can vary widely: some cultures emphasize rote learning and repetition, while others encourage creativity and improvisation. The roles of teachers, elders, peers, and family members are all important in the transmission of musical knowledge.

Socialization also involves learning the social meanings and functions of music—when and where it is appropriate to perform, who may participate, and what responses are expected from listeners. Through socialization, individuals come to understand the symbolic and emotional significance of music in their society, and how it relates to identity, status, and group membership.

### Conclusion

The conceptual matrix of music in society is shaped by local definitions, legitimization, expressive values, and processes of socialization. By examining these factors, we see how music is not only a product of individual creativity but also a deeply social phenomenon, embedded in the beliefs, practices, and institutions of every culture. Understanding these conceptual factors helps us appreciate the diversity of musical life and the ways in which music both reflects and shapes human experience.

## 4. Musicianship

### Pitch and Scales

Pitch is one of the most fundamental aspects of music, referring to the perceived highness or lowness of a sound. In every society, people organize pitches into systems that form the basis for melodies and harmonies. These systems are called scales. A scale is a set of pitches arranged in ascending or descending order, and different cultures use different types of scales, which can vary in the number of pitches and the intervals between them.

Western music is most familiar with the diatonic scale, which consists of seven pitches per octave, and the chromatic scale, which divides the octave into twelve equal parts. However, many other cultures use pentatonic (five-note), heptatonic (seven-note), or even microtonal scales that include intervals smaller than those found in Western music. For example, the music of Java and Bali in Indonesia uses scales called slendro and pelog, which have intervals that do not correspond to Western tuning systems.

The choice of scale and tuning system has a profound effect on the character of a musical tradition. It shapes the melodies, harmonies, and expressive possibilities available to musicians. Understanding the diversity of pitch systems around the world helps us appreciate the variety of musical expression and the ways in which different societies conceptualize sound.

### Timbre and Tone Quality

Timbre, often referred to as tone quality or color, is what makes one musical sound distinct from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. Timbre is determined by the physical characteristics of the sound source, such as the material, shape, and method of sound production, as well as by the way the sound is played or sung. For example, a violin and a flute playing the same note at the same volume will sound different because of their unique timbres.

Every musical culture values certain timbres and develops instruments and vocal techniques to produce them. In some societies, a clear, pure tone is preferred, while in others, a rough or nasal quality may be considered beautiful. The variety of timbres used in music around the world reflects both the available materials and the aesthetic preferences of each culture.

Understanding timbre and tone quality helps us appreciate the diversity of musical sounds and the creative ways in which musicians shape their sonic environment.

### Rhythm

Rhythm is the organization of sounds and silences in time. It is one of the most universal aspects of music, present in every musical tradition, though the ways in which rhythm is structured and valued can vary greatly between cultures. Rhythm involves patterns of duration, accent, and timing, and is often what gives music its sense of movement and energy.

Some musical traditions emphasize regular, repeating patterns of beats, as in much Western popular and classical music. Others, such as Indian classical music or West African drumming, may use complex cycles, syncopation, or polyrhythms—multiple rhythms occurring simultaneously. The perception and performance of rhythm are shaped by cultural expectations and training, and what sounds natural in one tradition may seem unusual in another.

Rhythm is not only a feature of instrumental music but is also central to vocal music, dance, and ritual. It can serve to coordinate group activity, mark the passage of time, or create emotional intensity. Understanding the diversity of rhythmic systems helps us appreciate the richness and variety of musical expression around the world.

### Melody

Melody is a sequence of pitches perceived as a single, coherent line. It is often the most recognizable and memorable aspect of a piece of music. Melodies can be simple or complex, and their structure is shaped by the scale system, rhythmic patterns, and expressive conventions of a culture.

In some musical traditions, melody is highly ornamented, with elaborate embellishments and variations, while in others it may be more straightforward and repetitive. The range, contour, and phrasing of melodies are influenced by the capabilities of the human voice and musical instruments, as well as by aesthetic preferences.

Melodies often carry cultural meanings and associations, and can evoke strong emotional responses. They may be used to tell stories, convey messages, or mark important events. Studying melody across cultures reveals both the universality and diversity of musical creativity.

### Form

Form refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music—the way it is organized in time. Musical form can range from simple, repetitive patterns to complex, multi-part compositions. Common forms include strophic (repeating the same music for each verse), binary (two contrasting sections), ternary (three-part), and through-composed (new music throughout).

Different cultures have developed distinctive forms suited to their musical materials and social functions. For example, the call-and-response form is widespread in African and African diasporic music, while the raga form in Indian classical music provides a framework for improvisation and development.

Understanding musical form helps us recognize patterns, anticipate changes, and appreciate the artistry involved in creating and performing music. It also provides insight into the ways music is used to structure social events and rituals.

### Multipart Music

Multipart music involves two or more independent musical lines or parts performed simultaneously. This can include harmony (different pitches sounding together), polyphony (multiple melodic lines), or heterophony (variations of the same melody played together). Multipart music is found in many cultures, though the specific techniques and aesthetic goals vary widely.

In Western classical music, harmony and counterpoint are highly developed, while in other traditions, such as the vocal polyphony of the Balkans or the interlocking patterns of Indonesian gamelan, multipart music takes different forms. Multipart music often requires coordination and cooperation among performers, and can serve to express social relationships and group identity.

Exploring multipart music broadens our understanding of the possibilities of musical organization and the ways in which people collaborate to create complex sonic textures.

## 5. Meaning in Music

### Music as Symbol

Music often serves as a powerful symbol in human societies, carrying meanings that go beyond the sounds themselves. As a symbolic system, music can represent ideas, emotions, social relationships, and cultural values. The meaning of music is not inherent in the notes or rhythms, but is constructed through the ways people interpret and use it within their cultural context.

In many societies, specific musical forms, instruments, or styles are associated with particular events, groups, or beliefs. For example, a national anthem symbolizes the identity and unity of a nation, while a wedding song may symbolize the transition to a new stage of life. Instruments themselves can be symbolic: the mbira in Zimbabwe is not only a musical instrument but also a symbol of ancestral connection and spiritual power.

The symbolic meanings of music are often communicated through lyrics, performance practices, and the contexts in which music is heard. Rituals, ceremonies, and festivals use music to mark important transitions, reinforce social bonds, and express shared values. The interpretation of musical symbols can vary widely, even within a single society, depending on individual experience and perspective.

Understanding music as symbol helps us see how music participates in the construction of meaning and identity, and how it can be used to communicate complex ideas and emotions that may be difficult to express in words.

### Music as Aesthetic

Music is also valued for its aesthetic qualities—the beauty, expressiveness, and emotional impact of sound. The aesthetic dimension of music is shaped by cultural preferences, historical traditions, and individual taste. What is considered beautiful or moving in one society may not be valued in another, and aesthetic standards can change over time.

Aesthetic appreciation of music involves both sensory perception and intellectual engagement. Listeners may respond to melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre, and form, as well as to the skill and creativity of performers. In some cultures, the aesthetic experience of music is closely linked to spiritual or emotional states, while in others it may be more focused on technical mastery or innovation.

The study of music as aesthetic explores how people experience and evaluate music, how aesthetic values are taught and transmitted, and how they influence the creation and reception of musical works. It also considers the ways in which aesthetic judgments are used to define group boundaries, establish hierarchies, and negotiate social relationships.

### Conclusion

The meaning of music is multifaceted, encompassing its role as symbol, its aesthetic qualities, and its capacity to evoke emotion and communicate ideas. By examining how music is interpreted and valued in different societies, we gain insight into the ways in which music shapes and reflects human experience. Understanding the meaning of music helps us appreciate its power to connect people, express identity, and give voice to the deepest aspects of human life.

## 6. Uses and Functions of Music

### Music and Its Functions

Music serves a wide range of functions in human societies, from the most personal and individual to the most public and collective. It can be used for entertainment, communication, ritual, education, healing, and social control. The functions of music are shaped by cultural values, social structures, and individual needs, and they often overlap or change depending on the context.

In many societies, music is an essential part of religious and ceremonial life, marking important transitions and reinforcing social bonds. It can also serve as a means of expressing identity, solidarity, or resistance. On a personal level, music can provide comfort, inspiration, or a way to process emotions. The uses and functions of music are as diverse as the societies that create it, reflecting the complexity of human experience.

### Music and Environmental Adaptation

Music is often adapted to the physical and social environment in which it is produced. The materials available for making instruments, the acoustics of performance spaces, and the rhythms of daily life all influence the forms and functions of music. For example, nomadic societies may favor portable instruments, while agricultural societies may develop music for communal labor or seasonal festivals.

Environmental adaptation also includes the ways in which music responds to social and historical changes. As societies encounter new technologies, ideas, or challenges, their musical practices may evolve to meet new needs or express new realities. The adaptability of music is one of its most enduring strengths, allowing it to remain relevant across generations and contexts.

### Individual Strategies and the Use of Music

Individuals use music in many ways to navigate their lives and relationships. Music can be a tool for self-expression, a means of coping with stress, or a way to connect with others. People may use music to create a sense of privacy, to motivate themselves, or to mark special occasions. The strategies individuals use in engaging with music are influenced by personal preferences, cultural norms, and social circumstances.

Music can also serve as a form of social negotiation, helping individuals to assert their identity, build alliances, or challenge authority. The personal uses of music are as varied as the people who make and listen to it, demonstrating the flexibility and power of musical expression.

### Types of Uses and Functions

The uses and functions of music can be categorized in many ways, but some common types include:

- Ritual and religious functions
- Social and recreational functions
- Educational and developmental functions
- Political and economic functions
- Therapeutic and healing functions
- Personal and emotional functions

Each of these types can be found in different forms and combinations across societies. Understanding the types of uses and functions helps us see how music is woven into the fabric of daily life and how it serves both individual and collective needs.

### Conclusion

The uses and functions of music are central to its role in human life. By examining how music is used in different contexts, we gain insight into the ways it shapes and is shaped by social, cultural, and personal forces. Music is not only an art form but also a vital tool for adaptation, communication, and meaning-making in every society.

## 7. Change and Continuity

### Music and Anthropological Views of Change

Change is a constant feature of human societies, and music is no exception. Anthropologists have long studied how cultures adapt, transform, and maintain continuity in the face of internal developments and external influences. Music provides a valuable lens for examining these processes, as it both reflects and shapes broader patterns of social and cultural change.

Musical traditions may change gradually over time or undergo rapid transformation due to technological innovation, migration, colonization, or contact with other cultures. At the same time, societies often seek to preserve certain musical forms as symbols of identity, heritage, or resistance to change. The interplay between change and continuity in music reveals much about the values, priorities, and adaptive strategies of different groups.

### Changeable Features of Music

Some aspects of music are more susceptible to change than others. Instruments, performance practices, and musical styles may be adopted, adapted, or abandoned as circumstances shift. New genres can emerge, and old ones may fade or be revived. The transmission of musical knowledge—whether oral, written, or mediated by technology—also affects how traditions evolve.

However, not all features of music change at the same rate. Core concepts, social functions, or symbolic meanings may persist even as surface features are transformed. The selective retention or modification of musical elements is shaped by social, political, and economic factors, as well as by the agency of musicians and communities.

### Processes of Change in Music

Several processes drive musical change, including:

- Innovation: the creation of new forms, instruments, or styles
- Diffusion: the spread of musical ideas and practices across groups
- Syncretism: the blending of different musical traditions
- Standardization: the establishment of norms or canons
- Revitalization: the deliberate revival or reinterpretation of older forms

These processes can occur independently or in combination, and their outcomes are often unpredictable. The study of musical change highlights the creativity and adaptability of human societies.

### Culture Contact and Music Change

Contact between cultures—through trade, migration, colonization, or media—has been a major force in musical change. Such encounters can lead to the exchange, fusion, or contestation of musical forms. While some traditions are lost or marginalized, others are transformed or enriched by new influences.

Culture contact can also raise questions of power, appropriation, and authenticity. The adoption of musical elements from one group by another may be celebrated as innovation or criticized as exploitation. Understanding the dynamics of culture contact helps us appreciate both the opportunities and challenges of musical change in a globalized world.

### Conclusion

Change and continuity are fundamental aspects of musical life. By examining how music adapts, persists, or transforms, we gain insight into the resilience and creativity of human societies. The study of musical change encourages us to value both tradition and innovation, and to recognize the complex forces that shape the sounds of our world.

## 8. Music in Modern Life

### Modern Society

Modern society is characterized by rapid technological change, urbanization, and increasing global interconnectedness. These developments have transformed the ways in which music is created, distributed, and experienced. The rise of mass media, digital technology, and global communication networks has made it possible for musical styles and ideas to circulate widely and quickly, crossing traditional boundaries of geography, language, and culture.

In modern societies, music is often a site of innovation and experimentation, as well as a means of expressing contemporary concerns and identities. At the same time, the pressures of commercialization and standardization can challenge the diversity and authenticity of musical traditions. The relationship between tradition and modernity is a central theme in the study of music in modern life.

### Functions

Music continues to serve many of the same functions in modern society as it has in the past: entertainment, ritual, communication, education, and social cohesion. However, new functions have also emerged, such as the use of music in advertising, therapy, and political activism. The accessibility of recorded music and streaming platforms has changed the ways people listen to and interact with music, making it a more individualized and portable experience.

Music also plays a key role in shaping public spaces, from background music in stores and restaurants to large-scale concerts and festivals. It can be used to create atmosphere, influence behavior, and foster a sense of community or belonging. The functions of music in modern life are continually evolving in response to social, technological, and economic changes.

### Musical Values

The values attached to music in modern society are diverse and sometimes contested. Issues of authenticity, originality, and cultural ownership are frequently debated, especially as musical styles are borrowed, adapted, or commercialized across cultural boundaries. The global music industry exerts a powerful influence on what is produced, promoted, and consumed, but local and independent scenes continue to thrive and innovate.

Questions of value also arise in relation to music education, public funding for the arts, and the preservation of musical heritage. The ways in which societies value music reflect broader attitudes toward culture, identity, and social change.

### The Future

The future of music in human life will be shaped by ongoing developments in technology, society, and culture. New forms of musical creation and participation are likely to emerge, along with new challenges and opportunities for musicians and audiences. As music continues to adapt and evolve, it will remain a vital means of expression, connection, and meaning-making for people around the world.
